Set in the swinging London scene of the early 1970's, the last gasp of the hippie era clashes with the chic international jet set. The result is this triangular jewel of a movie. Robert Blakeley (Michael Caine) is married to the glamorous, manic and barren Zee (Elizabeth Taylor). Intricate games and a few threads of love hold the marriage together. Into the volatile mix comes Stella, a younger woman who is on the edge and ready for a little shove. Michael Caine and Susannah York are great actors in any right. Mr. Caine particularly shines in this film. However in `X, Y and Zee' both actors are blown off the screen by an inspired comic performance by Elizabeth Taylor. Not often given the chance to play comedy she turns in a well-timed and poignantly funny performance in this Black Comedy of marriage, sexual confusion, and social boredom. It is sad that Miss Taylor was mostly relegated to dramas and not allowed often enough to stretch her comic wings. You can see flashes of her comic abilities in such odd fare as &quot;Boom&quot;, &quot;Reflections In A Golden Eye&quot; and &quot;Hammersmith Is Out!&quot; But in this film she soars as a woman of wit and warmth who will stop at nothing to come out on top.\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name:  XY_AND_ZEE_1972.m4v \n- Container:  M4V - QuickTime \n- Size:  714.08 MB \n- Duration:  1h 48mn \n- Bitrate:  879 Kbps \n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \n- Bitrate:  Max.: Undefined / Average: 754 Kbps / Min.: Undefined \n- Frame rate (fps):  Max.: 29.970 / Average: 23.976 / Min.: 19.969 \n- Encoding profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c984a8a0a78985fae7f9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n- Image size:  720*464 (Actual 854 x 464 pixels)\n- Pixel Aspect Ratio:  Undefined \n- Display Aspect Ratio:  1.85:1 \n- Interlacing:  Progressive \n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  AAC - MPEG-4 audio \n- Bitrate:  118 Kbps \n- Resolution:  Undefined \n- Rate:  48.0 KHz \n- Channel(s):  2 (stereo) \n- Position:  Front: L R \n\ntags: drama, architect, triangle, dysfunctional marriage, adultery, vulgarity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec2dccfd1ee2ac9cf9520019ad89020f7aff5a6","amp;dn":"X%2C+Y+and+Zee+1972+Michael+Caine+DvDRip+x264+AAC-miKem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec2dccfd1ee2ac9cf9520019ad89020f7aff5a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,194,220,207,209,238,42,201,207,149,32,1,154,216,144,32,247,175,245,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
