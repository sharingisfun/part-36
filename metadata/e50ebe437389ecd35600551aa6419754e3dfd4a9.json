(Despite their shared surname, Tom and Russ Wilson were not related.)\n\nThe band got its first widespread exposure opening for Crash Vegas on that band's tour to support their debut album, Red Earth. Crash Vegas member Colin Cripps was one of Junkhouse's early mentors and supporters.\n\nIn 1993, the band signed to Sony Records, and released a Sony Music publishing demo Here Lies Happiness, which was a collection of their early recordings. In September 1993 they released their official debut, Strays, and promoted the album by touring as an opening act for The Waltons and Soul Asylum. That album was produced by Malcolm Burn, and produced radio hits for the band with &quot;Out of My Head&quot;, &quot;Prayin' for the Rain&quot; and &quot;Big Brown Turtle&quot;.\n\nThe band was also featured on the soundtrack to the television show Due South. Their cover of the song &quot;Oh, What a Feeling&quot; is on the first of the two soundtracks from the Paul Haggis show.\n\nIn 1995, they released Birthday Boy, which included a duet with Sarah McLachlan on the song &quot;Burned Out Car&quot;.\n\nRuss Wilson left the band in 1996, and was replaced by Grant Marshall.\n\nIn 1997 Colin Cripps joined the band after the dissolution of Crash Vegas.[3] Junkhouse released their final album, Fuzz which was primarily written by Wilson and Cripps.[4] Following that album, the band members went their separate ways. Tom Wilson has released two solo albums, Planet Love in 2001 and Dog Years in 2006, and has collaborated with Stephen Fearing and Colin Linden in the supergroup Blackie and the Rodeo Kings.\n\nAlthough no longer recording, the band still performs together occasionally, most recently with Finger Eleven at a tsunami benefit in Hamilton on February 2, 2005.[1]\n\nThe group reunited on November 7, 2009 to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a concert at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern.[1]\n\nDan Achen owned Catherine North Studio in Hamilton. Several internationally known artists have recorded at Catherine North over the past 10 years, including AchenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s niece Feist. At a 2008 concert at Hamilton Place, the Grammy-nominated singer held up her favourite red guitar and proudly announced that it was a gift from &quot;Uncle Dan&quot;.\n\nIn 2008, Achen co-produced a Juno-winning album Bring Me Your Love, a solo project by Dallas Green of the platinum-selling rock band Alexisonfire.\n\nDan Achen died on March 15, 2010 of a heart attack while playing hockey.[5] On March 20, 2010, Ron McLean profiled Dan Achen and Junkhouse with a segment prior to the Leafs-Canadiens game on Hockey Night in Canada. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRounders 2002\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n \t\t01 Out of My Head\n \t\t02 Garbage Night\n \t\t03 Praying for the Rain\n \t\t04 F-! #in Up\n \t\t05 Gimmie the Love\n \t\t06 Burn for You\n \t\t07 Joyride\n \t\t08 Burned Out Car\n \t\t09 Be Someone\n \t\t10 The Sky Is Falling\n \t\t11 This Old Man's Too Drunk to Drive [Live]\n \t\t12 Pearly White\n \t\t13 Oh What a Feeling\n \t\t14 Big Brown Turtle\n \t\t15 Brown Shoe\n \t\t16 Praying for the Rain [Rain Jam Edit]\n \t\t17 Jesus Sings the Blues\n \t\t18 Tiger Balm\n \t\t19 Shine\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50ebe437389ecd35600551aa6419754e3dfd4a9","amp;dn":"Junkhouse+-+Rounders+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2002+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50ebe437389ecd35600551aa6419754e3dfd4a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,14,190,67,115,137,236,211,86,0,85,26,166,65,151,84,227,223,212,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
