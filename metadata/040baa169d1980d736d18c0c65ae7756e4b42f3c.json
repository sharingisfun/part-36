Thompson approached Vann to form a band, known as Night, soon after Vann's own backing group, Bones had split up. Night then later split in 1983 after releasing two albums. They had two Top 40 hits in the U.S. in 1979: &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot; (#18, originally written and recorded by Walter Egan) and &quot;If You Remember Me&quot; (#17). The latter single, recorded as the theme song for Franco Zeffirelli's remake of The Champ, was originally credited solely to Chris Thompson; later pressings of the single were credited to &quot;Chris Thompson and Night.&quot;\nNight can be seen in the film The Monster Club performing &quot;The Stripper&quot;.  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBiography\tby Doug Stone   allmusic.com\nNight was a loose, L.A.-based assemblage of session pros including Stevie Lange, who sang behind Graham Bonnet and Elton John; Chris Thompson, who contributed to War of the Worlds and worked for Manfred Mann's Earth Band (MMEB); and keyboard wizard Nicky Hopkins, who played with everybody. Night first released a cover of Walter Egan's minor single, &quot;Hot Summer Nights.&quot; The track cracked the Top 20, but was to be the only chart appearance for the band. Auteur producer Richard Perry distributed the accompanying eponymous debut on his Planet label in 1979. A second LP, Long Distance, popped up the following year, but quickly faded. Thompson returned to MMEB, and Night fell in 1982. The talented Lange would go on to contribute to his solo record, High Cost of Living, and also work with numerous greats, including Gang of Four, Johnny Hates Jazz, the Mighty Lemon Drops, and Swing Out Sister.  \n\nTracklist &amp; (Musicians From www.Discogs):\nA01.
