In this installment, Deke takes you through Photoshop's more advanced features.â€¨â€¨Learn about Photoshop's automated selection tools (Color Range, Focus Area, and Refine Edge), the nondestructive editing capabilities of Smart Objects, Liquify's slimming and trimming power, and techniques for drawing and designing with vector shapes.

These tutorials feature all-new projects and exercise files, so there's something new for even long-time Deke fans.â€¨â€¨And there's more to come.
