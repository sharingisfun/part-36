And even if the imagery is most immediately resonant of summer in\nPortugal, the Clean Feed label's home turf, intentionally or not, there is a\nconnection to the music on the metal (yes, it does have something to do with\ndeep ends).\n\nRemarkably, the album is the first to be released under his own name by ninja of\nnuance Rainey, from the early 1990s a prominent figure on New York's Downtown\nscene. In a 2004 interview with All About Jazz, he declared himself creatively\nfulfilled by his role as sideman/collaborator, &quot;playing with friends who trust\nme,&quot; and revealed no plans to form his own band. Whatever it may be that has\ncaused him to change his mind, ears laugh at their good fortune.\n\nThe two friends who collaborate with Rainey here are guitarist Mary Halvorson\nand saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock, each a major new voice on her instrument. Both\ncan create intensely visceral music yet are equally at home on more cerebral,\nlong-form material, be it pre-composed or improvised. Both are sonic adventurers\nsignificantly extending the lexicons of their instruments. Stir in Rainey's\nyin/yang rhythmatism and fascination follows.\n\nThe album has echoes of Laubrock's wholly in-the-moment, collective improv\nsuite, Sleepthief (Intakt, 2009), on which Rainey made up a trio with pianist\nLiam Noble; though not completely improvised, Pool School has a high ratio of\nsustained, unscripted, collective invention. But variety of atmosphere and form\nis a hallmark of the set. The 12 tracks move adroitly between the composed and\nthe improvised, the inside and the outside, the sun lounger and the deep\nend. It's often impossible to tell where the one starts and the other begins.\n\nIs the wonderfully synchronous coming together of all three players which\nhappens on &quot;Pool School&quot; itself 2:38 minutes in, for instance, the result of\nexperience and empathy or pre-planning? Similar moments occur throughout the\ndiscÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½some, such as &quot;Home Opener&quot;'s halfway transition from the voluptuous to the\nspiky and &quot;Coney&quot;'s reverse direction shift, sounding as though they were\ndeliberated in advance by the musicians.\n\nWell, anyway. In the end, the precise route taken doesn't matter. This playful,\nempathetic trio hits the spot, and Pool School reveals new pleasures with each\nrepeated spin.\n\n\nEn castellano: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2010/06/tom-rainey-trio-pool-school.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2010/06/tom-rainey-trio-pool-school.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22799982039a031e19106d1e4868999fc34436f1","amp;dn":"Tom+Rainey+Trio+-+Pool+School+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22799982039a031e19106d1e4868999fc34436f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,121,153,130,3,154,3,30,25,16,109,30,72,104,153,159,195,68,54,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
