Part One introduces fundamental programming concepts, using simple examples to put new concepts quickly into practice. Part Two covers the fundamentals of algorithms and numerical analysis at a level allowing you to quickly apply results in practical settings.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tTips, warnings, and &quot;try this&quot; features within each chapter help the reader develop good programming practices\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tChapter summaries, key terms, and functions and operators lists at the end of each chapter allow for quick access to important information\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAt least three different types of end of chapter exercises - thinking, writing, and coding - let you assess your understanding and practice what you've learned","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca6559aeefe969a3fc95bf171f58fa6d23b2c86","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+MATLAB+Programming+and+Numerical+Methods+for","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca6559aeefe969a3fc95bf171f58fa6d23b2c86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,166,85,154,238,254,150,154,63,201,91,241,113,245,143,166,210,59,44,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
