Bell was able to convince KLJB management to broadcast the performance without commercial interruption. \n\nBell and Harper recorded the show on both multi-track and two-track. When no one claimed this incredible performance's multi-track master a few weeks after the show, it was erased and recycled! The two-track reel collected dust for twelve years in Wayne Bell's personal library and is the source or this recording.\n\nThis performance led talent scout John Hammond to sign SRV &amp; DT a recording deal with Epic Records.\n\n\nThis was released about two years after Vaughan's death.\n\nDouble Trouble: Chris Layton, drums, and Jackie Newhouse, bass guitar. (Newhouse was replaced by bassist Tommy Shannon in January 1981)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53bbacf2b07da53c8b3a78ba7b9b21d9f2039d59","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+%26amp%3B+Double+Trouble+-+In+The+Beginning+-+Liv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53bbacf2b07da53c8b3a78ba7b9b21d9f2039d59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,187,172,242,176,125,165,60,139,58,120,186,123,155,33,217,242,3,157,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
