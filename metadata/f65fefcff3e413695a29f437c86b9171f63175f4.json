While much of the novel takes place in Europe, its main characters are American, not British. The protagonist is a disillusioned veteran of World War I who abandons his wealthy friends and lifestyle, travelling to India seeking enlightenment. The story's themes of Eastern mysticism and war-weariness struck a chord with readers as World War II waned, and a movie adaptation quickly followed.\n\nMaugham's masterpiece is generally agreed to be &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;.\nHe was one of the most popular authors of his era, and reputedly the highest paid of his profession during the 1930s.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f65fefcff3e413695a29f437c86b9171f63175f4","amp;dn":"THE+RAZOR%5C%27S+EDGE+-+W.+Somerset+Maugham.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f65fefcff3e413695a29f437c86b9171f63175f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,95,239,207,243,228,19,105,90,41,244,55,200,107,145,113,246,49,117,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
