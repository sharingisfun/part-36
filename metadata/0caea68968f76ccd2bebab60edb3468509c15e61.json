Its main goal is to give an overview of the subject but, unusual for a popular science book, it also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. The author notes that an editor warned him that for every equation in the book the readership would be halved, hence it includes only a single equation: E = mcÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â². In addition to Hawking's abstinence from equations, the book also simplifies matters by means of illustrations throughout the text, depicting complex models and diagrams.\n\nThe book is considered by many to be an &quot;unread bestseller&quot;, which is a book many people own but few have finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information and to discuss this book, please visit us in our group to Facebook.   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25585203372&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25585203372&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- We believe that the separation of religion and state is the solution -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0caea68968f76ccd2bebab60edb3468509c15e61","amp;dn":"%C3%98%C2%AA%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%B1%C3%99%C5%A0%C3%98%C2%AE+%C3%99%E2%80%A6%C3%99%CB%86%C3%98%C2%AC%C3%98%C2%B2+%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%98%C2%B2%C3%99%E2%80%A6%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%E2%80%A0+%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%98%C2%B3%C3%98%C2%AA%C3%99%C5%A0%C3%99%C2%81%C3%99%E2%80%A0+%C3%99%E2%80%A1%C3%99%CB%86%C3%99%C6%92%C3%99%C5%A0%C3%99%E2%80%A0%C3%98%C2%AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0caea68968f76ccd2bebab60edb3468509c15e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,174,166,137,104,247,108,205,43,235,171,96,237,179,70,133,9,193,94,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
