It's just a shame there are so few stories in total.\n\nThe 4 collections were titled:-\nGhost Stories (1982)\nMore Ghost Stories (1984)\nA Warning to the Curious and other Ghost Stories (1985)\nNumber 13 and other Ghost Stories (1988)\n\nGhost Stories 1982\nThe Ash Tree\nRats\nA School Story\nThe Haunted Dolls' House\nThe Diary of Mr Poynter\n\nMore Ghost Stories 1984\nThere was a man dwelt by a Churchyard\nLost Hearts\nOh, Whistle, and I'll come to you, my lad\nThe Mezzotint\nCasting the Runes\n\nA Warning to the Curious and other Ghost Stories 1985\nStories I have tried to write\nThe Uncommon Prayer-book\nA Warning to the Curious\nA Neighbour's Landmark\nThe Rose Garden\n\nNumber 13 and other Ghost Stories 1988\nCount Magnus\nCanon Alberics Scrap-book\nThe Stalls of Barchester\nNumber 13\n\nAll files are 128 kbps stereo except the third collection from 1985 which is 48 kbps mono.\nThere's one exception in the 1985 set. That is for the story A Warning to the Curious itself which I\nripped from the BFI DVD of the BBC TV version of the story from 1972 where it's included as an extra.\nIt's in stereo at 128 kbps.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6030cc109e91c7532a2d9e45e9da448799fda8a0","amp;dn":"M+R+James+read+by+Michael+Hordern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6030cc109e91c7532a2d9e45e9da448799fda8a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,48,204,16,158,145,199,83,42,45,158,69,233,218,68,135,153,253,168,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
