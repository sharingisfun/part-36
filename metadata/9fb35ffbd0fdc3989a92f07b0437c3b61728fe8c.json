From the Soweto Gospel Choir to Allan Ginsberg, Willie Nelson to Mary J Blige and Mick Jagger to Green Day, the band have curated a collection of 'duals' which highlight the remarkable range of artists they've worked with.\r\n\r\nA few of the fifteen tracks have featured on studio albums, but many have had only limited previous availability and some are released here for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe think it's a pretty special collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Where The Streets Have No Name (with Soweto Gospel Choir)\r\n02 - The Wanderer (with Johnny Cash)\r\n03 - Falling At Your Feet (Bono and Danny Lanois)\r\n04 - Miss Sarajevo (Passengers and Luciano Pavarotti)\r\n05 - Slow Dancing (with Willie Nelson)\r\n06 - The Saints Are Coming (with Green Day)\r\n07 - Sunday Bloody Sunday (Live from Auckland) (with Jay-Z)\r\n08 - One (with Mary J Blige)\r\n09 - When Love Comes To Town (with BB King)\r\n10 - Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of (Live at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame)  (with Mick Jagger)\r\n11 - The Ballad Of Ronnie Drew (with The Dubliners, Kila, A Band of Bowsies)\r\n12 - I'm Not Your Baby (with Sinead O'Connor)\r\n13 - Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour) - Hybrid Mix (Jay-Z, Bono, The Edge, Rihanna)\r\n14 - Drunk Chicken~America (with Allen Ginsberg)\r\n15 - Amazing Grace (with Soweto Gospel Choir)\r\n\r\n*2011 Universal-Island Records / Mercury / Interscope | U2.COM6\r\n {Limited Edition U2.com Subscription}\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nU2 are:\r\nBono: Vocals\r\nThe Edge: Guitars\r\nAdam Clayton: Bass\r\nLarry Mullen Jr.: Drums\r\n\r\nOther Musicians:\r\nSoweto Gospel Choir, Johnny Cash, Danny Lanois, Passengers (Brian Eno &amp; U2), Luciano Pavarotti, Willie Nelson, Green Day, Jay-Z, Mary J Blige, BB King, Mick Jagger, The Dubliners, Kila, A Band of Bowsies, Sinead O'Connor, Rihanna, and Allen Ginsberg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore U2.com Music Edition Subscription Albums...\r\n\r\n\r\nU2 - From the Ground Up: Edge's Picks from U2 360Â° (2012):\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/12772116/U2_-_From_the_Ground_Up__Edge_s_Picks_from_U2_360_deg__%282012%29\r\n\r\n\r\nU2 - U22 (2012) [2CD]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14640756/U2_-_U22_(2012)_[2CD]_[EAC-FLAC]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fb35ffbd0fdc3989a92f07b0437c3b61728fe8c","amp;dn":"U2+-+Duals+%282011%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fb35ffbd0fdc3989a92f07b0437c3b61728fe8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,179,95,251,208,253,195,152,154,146,240,123,4,55,195,182,23,40,254,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
