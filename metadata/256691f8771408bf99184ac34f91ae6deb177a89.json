RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo playing has always had a tough edge, with his prodigious technique often employed in the service of dropping right-hand bombs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his use of a thumbpick originates from his years of duets with Twig Mike Gangloff, struggling to make his guitar heard over GangloffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crashing banjo. The front line of Rose and GangloffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strings are joined by Isak HowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no-nonsense guitar and harmonica and Nate BowlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ variety of expert percussion. The four players lock together with a sure-footedness honed by frequent touring and a singularity of intent to rock. Gangloff takes the vocals, howling out standards like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little SadieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ firmly in the old-time tradition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without reserve. A few of the tracks here are updates of Rose &amp; family classics, with the group turning the stately Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kensington BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ upbeat and an issuing an assured take on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bright Sunny South,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ first recorded by Pelt (w/Rose and Gangloff) back in 2001 on their gonzo classic double Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ayahuasca.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256691f8771408bf99184ac34f91ae6deb177a89","amp;dn":"+Jack+Rose+and+The+Black+Twig+Pickers+%5B2009%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256691f8771408bf99184ac34f91ae6deb177a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,102,145,248,119,20,8,191,153,24,74,195,79,145,174,109,235,23,122,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
