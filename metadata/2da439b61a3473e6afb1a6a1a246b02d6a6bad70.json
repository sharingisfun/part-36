Then again, would you expect less from one of Steven KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite bands?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Hills of HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells the story of two real life crucifixions in Kentucky and throws in the tale of a man who was brutally murdered, chewed beyond recognition by hounds, and then hidden in a dead horseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belly, just for good measure.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dixie Iron FistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ projects the subjugation of the Southern everyman set to a frenetic beat comparable to a hummingbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart on meth. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not Southern gentility sipping mint juleps in seersucker suits, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fighting to survive another day, just so you can wake up to get screwed over by the man again.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all just pulse-pounding, frantic and feral, rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hell on Agridustrial. ThÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Legendary Shack Shakers have really come into their own by combining their signature punk-billy with American roots music and agrarian industrial sounds. However, when the Shack Shakers employ roots and folk influences, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not drawing from traditional acoustic guitar folk; far from itÃ¢â‚¬â€ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pulling in the noises and rhythms of the hard labor that fractured working menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backs. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hammer and TongsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ portrays the struggle an unmalleable and defiant man beaten, pounded, and scorched by the machine, set to the beat of actual hammers hitting anvils, as are several other tracks, which also employ sounds from chains, trains, and tractors.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lost CauseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ draws from hundreds of years of Southern culture, channeling the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embracement of lost causes all the way back to the SouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Celtic bloodline, in a haunting Civil War-esque ballad that sounds like the Pogues on quaaludes.\n\nFor 14 tracks, Agridustrial haunts, rocks, and rollicks, but is also the kind of album that would probably creep out a girl on your first date. It could equally serve as the soundtrack for the beating of an innocent man as it could a piece of art to be subjectively studied for cultural implications. It needs to be listened to in the right place and time. Oh, and you probably shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play it if a pregnant lady is in the room.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da439b61a3473e6afb1a6a1a246b02d6a6bad70","amp;dn":"Th%27+Legendary+Shack%2AShakers+-+Agridustrial+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da439b61a3473e6afb1a6a1a246b02d6a6bad70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,164,57,182,26,52,115,230,175,177,166,161,162,70,176,45,106,107,173,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
