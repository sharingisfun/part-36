United beat QPR 2-0 at Loftus Road when they last met on 18 December, the same day City beat Arsene Wenger's team by a solitary goal in that reverse fixture.\n\nAs usual, there will also be a review of all the goals and action from Saturday's seven games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc33b6add4745291fb1389abcfae4a708e87401","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+-++08+Apr+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc33b6add4745291fb1389abcfae4a708e87401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,195,59,106,221,71,69,41,31,177,56,154,188,250,228,167,8,232,116,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
