Typical of Lamborghini special editions, the only thing it lacks is restraint. The 300,000 SVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s V12 engine launches it from 0 to 62 mph in just 3.2 seconds and can achieve a top speed of 212 miles per hour. Just 350 will be made of this lighter and more powerful version. The factory builds the car almost entirely by hand including its engine and the installation of the famous Lamborghini scissor doors. Every car is custombuilt to order and less than 3 cars are completed per day. Journey inside LamborghiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s factory in SantaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Agata Bolognese, Italy and witness the building of their fastest car ever the Murcilago SV. \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:616bc0e6addd209d0d2e9ab1fc9ac4f459b0e701","amp;dn":"National+Geographic%3A+Ultimate+Factories+-+Lamborghini+XviD+%28P2P%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"616bc0e6addd209d0d2e9ab1fc9ac4f459b0e701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,107,192,230,173,221,32,157,13,46,154,177,252,154,196,244,89,176,231,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
