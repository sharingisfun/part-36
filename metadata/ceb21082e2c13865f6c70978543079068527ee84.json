Few, if any books in the area have attempted to do this and achieve it, since those of Sagan. **The book presents the broadest, most complete, most up-to-date and most exciting account of humanity's fascination with, and future intentions regarding the Red Planet. **The book is built on the authors 31 years experience of astronomy and 22 years of communicating science to the public, resulting in many unique ideas and unprecedented ways of conveying them. The author is establishing a reputation in his country for this. Such an emphasis is a priority for the book - more so than conveying facts. Few currently available books approach the subject from such a stand point. **A new generation, the second generation since the start of space exploration, deserve literature that encapsulates the important issues of the subject and sets them on their own path of exploration. **The book connects with issues pertanent to todays world. In a global community full of stresses, this book unfolds a positive human story that is of direct relevance to everyone. In a world full of frivolous intrepetations and portrayed fear regarding science, the book brings to the table a grounded yet enigmatic perspective that will bestow a sense of optimism and inclusion.  \n\n\n# Paperback: 408 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; Softcover reprint of hardcover 1st ed. 2008 edition (October 29, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 144192230X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1441922304","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceb21082e2c13865f6c70978543079068527ee84","amp;dn":"Mars%2C+A+Cosmic+Stepping+Stone+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceb21082e2c13865f6c70978543079068527ee84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,178,16,130,226,193,56,101,246,199,9,120,84,48,121,6,133,39,238,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
