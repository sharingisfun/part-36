Better than &quot;part 1&quot; I think, but this time Klaus Schulze is producer only.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1 The Long Way To Acapulco (4:43)\n2 Dessert Inn (4:31)\n3 Berliner Nachtmusik (6:26)\n4 Pleasant Voyage (3:13)\n5 Pan Americana (4:19)\n6 Drive Me Funky (7:27)\n7 Millers Continental (4:35)\n8 Lovely Hitch Hiker (3:58)\n9 Highway (4:47)\n\nReleased 1990\n\nHard to find on CD? Rather impossible I would say.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8fdbb902924cf79583a0a5bfa778a8393fa4c3","amp;dn":"Klaus+Schulze+%26+Rainer+Bloss+-+Drive+Inn+Vol.2+%28New+age%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8fdbb902924cf79583a0a5bfa778a8393fa4c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,143,219,185,2,146,76,247,149,131,160,165,191,167,120,168,57,63,164,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
