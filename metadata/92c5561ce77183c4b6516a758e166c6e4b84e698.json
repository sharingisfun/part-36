Kay Francis plays a onetime singer who confesses to the murder of her pianist, Basil Rathbone. In flashback, we learn that Rathbone had been responsible for the breakup of Francis's marriage.\n\n(Revealing any more would spoil the movie. I guarantee you will never forget the last twenty minutes.)\n\n***\n\nName.........: Confession.avi\nFilesize.....: 1,125 MB (or 1,152,768 KB or 1,180,434,432 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:26:54 (125,016 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1742 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 60 kb/s, monophonic VBR \nFrame Size...: 608x448 (1.36:1) [=19:14]\n\nUploaded from a private tracker, with permission. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=2828&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=2828&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
