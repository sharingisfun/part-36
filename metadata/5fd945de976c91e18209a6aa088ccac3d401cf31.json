I got most of them in email attachments (forward type emails).... There was a time when I used to collect them and forward them to my friends but I have stopped doing that now... Infact every new person in the world of Internet likes to receive and forward emails... There used to be a craze in people for such things, but these days I don't think people really care for email forwards...\n\nAnyway, my first intention to come in torrent world was to distribute this stuff so that people from all over the world can download my collection... Earlier I just used to forward it to people via emails...\n\nI know people will download this and I hope you will like it....\n\nHere's a description of all the powerpoint presentations....\n\n\n13 Reasons For Living.pps\nBe Proud To Be Indian.pps\nBeautiful Thoughts.pps\nBlue Beauty - The Earth.pps\nChinese Luck.pps\nEmails.pps\nfood[1].ppt\nFriends.pps\nFriendship.pps\nKids.pps\nLook Into This.pps\nLuckier.pps\nPhoto Shoot.pps\nPut Mouse On Nose.ppt\nThe Bracelet.pps\nTomorrow.ppt\nUnconditional.pps\nWhy Men Die Early.pps\nYou &amp; God.pps\n\nMost of these presentations were forwarded to me by my friends Bharat Bhushan &amp; Kanishk Verma, mostly in 2005... But some were from other sources also, like &quot;Put Mouse On House.ppt&quot;, I don't remember exactly, but it was from Abandonia Forums I guess....\n\nWhy Men Die Early.pps is quite logical...\nFriends.pps is arguably the most beautiful presentation, it was provided by my Computer Science teacher, Ms. Sangeeta Dadlani, now Mrs Sangeeta Hemrajini...\nLook Into This.pps is the funniest of them all....\n\nfood[1].ppt :--- This is the most special powerpoint presentation for me... It was given to me by my bro's friend Vijay Kumar Diwakar back in 2001 when I had created my first ever email ID on rediffmail and I still had this email in my mailbox.....\n\n\nI guess I haven't bored you much....\n\nEnjoy the presentations.....\n\nIt is dedicated to all the lovers of PowerPoint (the software that made my entry into computer world because of my uncle, thank you very much), my friends and to every person to whom I had forwarded this presentations....\n\nthanx\nvipin\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd945de976c91e18209a6aa088ccac3d401cf31","amp;dn":"PowerPoint+Presentations...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd945de976c91e18209a6aa088ccac3d401cf31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,217,69,222,151,108,145,225,130,9,166,170,8,140,202,195,212,1,207,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
