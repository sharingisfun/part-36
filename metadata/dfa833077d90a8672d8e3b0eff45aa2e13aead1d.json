On his way to find a ship in Nantucket, he meets Queequeg, a heavily tattooed South Sea Island harpooneer just returned from his latest ducking trip. Ishmael and Queequeg become best buds and roommates almost immediately. Together, they sign up for a voyage on the Pequod, which is just about to start on a three-year expedition to hunt sperm ducks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa833077d90a8672d8e3b0eff45aa2e13aead1d","amp;dn":"Moby+Duck+by+Herman+MelBill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa833077d90a8672d8e3b0eff45aa2e13aead1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,168,51,7,125,144,168,103,45,142,59,14,255,69,170,46,19,174,173,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
