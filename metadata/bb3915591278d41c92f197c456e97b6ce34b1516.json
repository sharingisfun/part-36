Inspired by the natural surrounds of Byron Bay they shared an enthusiasm for a better world, which solidified them as friends and acted as the catalyst for creativity. The Byron Bay five piece released their highly acclaimed UNFD debut &quot;Divination&quot; in August of 2012, cementing their position in the hardcore/metal scene. \n\nThe first few years saw the band take to the roads around Australia off the back of several independently released EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, sharing their music, learning from their peers and each other whilst gaining an insight into the fundamentals of what it was to be a young touring act.\n\nThe natural progression towards a full-length release was imminent and in early 2012 INHEARTSWAKE made the trip to Random Awesome StudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Michigan, USA to record with renowned engineer Ã¢â‚¬ËœJosh SchroederÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (The Color Morale, For The Fallen Dreams, Legend). Meanwhile at home, national interest was increasing and it caught the eye of Melbourne based company UNFD, who went on to release Ã¢â‚¬Å“DivinationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and sign the band for worldwide management.\n\nINHEARTSWAKE have since shared stages across Australia and New Zealand with bands such as Parkway Drive, Enter Shikari &amp; Northlane. Playing over 100 dates in the first eight months of their albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cycle, INHEARTSWAKE have developed into a seasoned act while more recently being included as part of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrother In Arms TourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ across venues in Australia, Europe and the UK with The Amity Affliction. INHEARTSWAKE have also delivered capacity shows across two incredible headline tours as part of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“DivinationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album cycle. The latter being The Survival Tour, which saw them bring out CanadianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Counterparts for nine dates around Australia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3915591278d41c92f197c456e97b6ce34b1516","amp;dn":"In+Hearts+Wake+-+Divine+%28New+Single%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3915591278d41c92f197c456e97b6ce34b1516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,57,21,89,18,120,212,28,146,241,151,196,86,233,123,108,227,75,21,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
