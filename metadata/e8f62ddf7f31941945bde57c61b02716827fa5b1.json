This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne song on the chart was a hit eleven years ago, then re-emerged on the chart two years ago, and in this countdown is the highest debuting song of the week.\nCasey answewrs the question, &quot;What record holds the all time run in the top ten? (30 weeks).\nPaul McCartney's present group, Wings, knocks his former Group, The Beatles, out of the #1 spot on the album chart.\nBut a former member of one band, George Harrison of the Beatles, knocks his former band-mate (Paul McCartney) out of the #1 spot in the top 40, the only time this ever happens in chart history.\nPink Floyd (Money), and Deep Purple (Smoke On THe Water)!
