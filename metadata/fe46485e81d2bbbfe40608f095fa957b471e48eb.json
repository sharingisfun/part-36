In the end, their vision of social construction turned Kinsey on his head, and their model became the dominant paradigm of social science inquiry into human sexuality, and spurred the development of an entire field of Sexuality Studies. Sexual activity, they argued, was like other social processes, yet one of increasing importance in the construction of the self. Michael Kimmel has gathered together essays from three generations of scholars influenced by this perspective on sexuality.\n\nThese include many of the foremost social scientists writing and researching sexuality today. The book begins with Kimmel's reflections on the unusual careers of Gagnon and Simon, examines the construction of both sexual identity and sexual behaviors in a variety of settings, and ends with the two of them speaking in their own provocative voices about their perspective in interviews conducted originally for a German journal in 1998.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe46485e81d2bbbfe40608f095fa957b471e48eb","amp;dn":"The+Sexual+Self+-+The+Construction+of+Sexual+Scripts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe46485e81d2bbbfe40608f095fa957b471e48eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,70,72,94,129,210,187,191,228,6,8,240,149,250,149,123,71,30,72,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
