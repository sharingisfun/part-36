Pretty Polly (4:07)\n\nAllmusic review by Richie Unterberger:\n\n    After presenting almost all-original sets on his first two albums (albeit originals that sometimes borrowed heavily from traditional folk themes), Jansch opted to devote all of his third LP to traditional folk numbers. His future Pentangle partner John Renbourn joins him on four of the eight songs. Highlights include the ten-minute title track (whose length was a real oddity on contemporary folk albums of the time) and a cover of &quot;Nottamun Town&quot; (whose melody Dylan lifted for &quot;Masters of War&quot;). Not as original as the artist's first two LPs, the guitar and vocal work on these adaptations were still as influential to the '60s folk world as anything else in Jansch's catalog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39421cd28d48d3c66b39a755d8f8b577180e8f30","amp;dn":"Bert+Jansch+-+Jack+Orion+%281966%29+V0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39421cd28d48d3c66b39a755d8f8b577180e8f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,66,28,210,141,72,211,198,107,57,167,85,216,248,181,119,24,14,143,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
