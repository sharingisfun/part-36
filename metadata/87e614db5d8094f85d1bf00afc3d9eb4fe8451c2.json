By the 1970s this absence of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtransitional fossilsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was hotly debated; some palaeontologists wondering if the these Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmissing linksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ had been so quick that no trace of them was left.However, during the past three decades fossils of walking whales from Pakistan, feathered dinosaurs from China, fish with feet from the Arctic Circle, ape-like humans from Africa, and many more bizarre creatures that fill in crucial gaps in our understanding of evolution have all been unearthed. These discoveries have revolutionised the way in which the fossil record is read to make sense of life on Earth, including the evolution of human beings.WRITTEN IN STONE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a hugely compelling scientific history by an up-and-coming star of popular science Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the first account of the remarkable discovery of these gap fossils and of the new stories they tell about the evolution of life.
