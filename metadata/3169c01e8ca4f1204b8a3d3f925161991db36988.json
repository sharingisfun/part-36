Johnny Gore And The &quot;C&quot; Eaters (5:18)\n\nThere's a reason Hall &amp; Oates have erased this one from their history. &quot;War Babies&quot; is really a Todd Rundgren album in which Daryl Hall happens to be singing songs that he wrote.\n\nThe production is unmistakeable Todd. It sounds just like &quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; and &quot;Todd&quot;, his two 'psychedelic' albums that were recorded right around the same time (I think this fell in between the two, chronologically).\n\nTodd basically tosses Oates to the side, and takes over on guitar. Which is a good thing. His classic &quot;blistering&quot; solos are stamped over &quot;Is It a Star&quot;, sweet arpeggios on &quot;You're Much Too Soon&quot;, slide guitar solo on &quot;I'm Watching You&quot;, and funky licks on &quot;Better Watch Your Back&quot; (by far the catchiest song on here).\n\nHe has also enlisted the original rhythm section from Utopia (John Seigler on bass, Jon Wilcox on drums), so the songs are capable of meandering around, switching tempos at the drop of a hat. There's a frightening middle section on &quot;Is it a Star?&quot; that scared the hell out of me as a kid. Also, a sharp turn on &quot;Screaming Through December&quot; turns a haunting piano ballad into some weird spacey funk suite.\n\nAlso highlights are the lush &quot;Can't Stop the Music&quot; (the only John Oates penned song on the album), the clavinet-driven funk &quot;Beane G. and the Rose Tattoo&quot;, the melodically rich &quot;You're Much Too Soon&quot; (which is the closest you'll get to the &quot;classic&quot; Hall &amp; Oates sound), and the catchy title track &quot;War Baby Son of Zorro&quot;, which sounds like a cross between &quot;International Feel&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulavard&quot; from Todd's aforementioned AWATS album.\n\nSo, I would recommend this highly for Todd Rundgren fans who enjoy &quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot;. You've basically got the same lineup of talented musicians, with the addition of another really talented guy in Daryl Hall. Just don't expect &quot;Abandoned Luncheonette 2&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3169c01e8ca4f1204b8a3d3f925161991db36988","amp;dn":"Daryl+Hall+%26amp%3B+John+Oates+-+War+Babies+%5B1974%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3169c01e8ca4f1204b8a3d3f925161991db36988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,105,192,30,140,164,241,32,75,138,61,63,146,81,97,153,29,179,105,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
