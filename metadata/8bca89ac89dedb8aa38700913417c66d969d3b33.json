This live album draws on reggae, salsa, and Latin pop songs from Chao's first two excellent solo albums (Clandestino and Proxima EstaciÃƒÂ³n: Esperanza) as well as joyous gems from his time leading the more punk-tinged Mano Negra. While the styles vary as often as the languages (Chao flits from Spanish to English to French as he translates his life as a global nomad into his music), the common thread is a sense of vitality and hope. From the uplifting reggae of &quot;Bienvenida a Tijuana&quot; to the African pop and salsa of &quot;Casa Babylon&quot; this album showcases Chao's role as the pied piper of multiculturalism, leading his crowd on a (literally) merry dance. And it's the crowd that really makes these 29 tracks come into their own. You can almost picture the mob waving, cheering, blowing whistles, shouting into megaphones, and generally having the wildest time this side of Rio Mardi Gras. A great flashback for those who have seen Chao live and a perfect introduction for recent converts. --Ian Watson \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bca89ac89dedb8aa38700913417c66d969d3b33","amp;dn":"Manu+Chao+-+Radio+Bemba+Sound+System+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bca89ac89dedb8aa38700913417c66d969d3b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,202,137,172,137,222,219,138,163,135,0,145,52,23,198,109,150,157,59,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
