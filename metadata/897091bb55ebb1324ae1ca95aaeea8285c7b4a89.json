Re-live Phil Archer's courtship of Grace Fairbrother, and the shock of her death in the horrific fire at the stables. Sympathise with Peggy as she copes bravely with the shame of Jennifer's illegitimate baby. Follow the stories of young Tony Archer, as he is bowled over by the energetic Welsh lass, Pat Lewis; and Brian Aldridge, who sweeps Jennifer off her feet. There are also scenes from the early years of Phil and Jill's 52-year marriage, and some of the earliest appearances of their four children. These vintage moments offer lifelong fans the chance to re-live some of the most dramatic and memorable events of the residents of Ambridge, and give new fans a fascinating glimpse into the early years of this much-cherished radio series.
