Moore, University of Oxford, UK\n\n&quot;'This sentence is false' is a sentence printed on the cover of this book. A sentence is not a name. So what is the name of the book? This book (whatever its name) is full of intriguing philosophical puzzles ... Paradoxes may seem trivial at first glance, but further thought reveals them to be challenges to some of our most fundamental beliefs and preconceptions. Peter Cave entertainingly escorts the reader through a great variety of these fascinating puzzles, shining light that is fresh and bright.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594a2d689b7dba28928f697bb80ad3cb571df6d3","amp;dn":"This+Sentence+is+False+-Cave-+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+PDF_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594a2d689b7dba28928f697bb80ad3cb571df6d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,74,45,104,155,125,186,40,146,143,105,123,184,10,211,203,87,29,246,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
