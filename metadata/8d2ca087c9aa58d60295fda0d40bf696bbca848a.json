All in one recorder, editor and player. The program specially designed to save recorded sound in real-time into two files simultaneously. Saving is performed into the high quality uncompressed temporary file and/or into an audio one. It supports MP3, OGG, WMA, WAV and FLAC format. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure what format settings you need or/and you want to edit a recorded sound this program for you. With Dual Audio Recorder you can play both files and select format settings that will satisfy you, select any portion of the temporary file and edit it by amplifying, normalizing, fading in/out. All editing operations are performed in real-time and practically do not require any time. Also you can choose saving only the temporary file or only an audio one. Before recording you can select a recording device of your PC and using the peak real-time indicator adjust recording level to obtain strong signal without sound clipping. The program allows you to remove undesirable DC Offset and apply fade in/out effects directly to initial recordings. Dual Audio Recorder has the file list with the recorded files and built-in player that displays peak level and spectrum of a played sound and shows main audio file properties.\n\nSupported Platforms: \n\nWindows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7\n\nHomepage: http://www.adrosoft.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given name/serial.\n- Restart application.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2ca087c9aa58d60295fda0d40bf696bbca848a","amp;dn":"Adrosoft+Dual+Audio+Recorder+v2.0+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2ca087c9aa58d60295fda0d40bf696bbca848a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,44,160,135,201,170,88,214,2,149,253,160,212,11,246,150,187,202,132,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
