A decade-long celebration of growth and power, fueled by the victory in WWII. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner David Halbertstam's bestselling book, this lively series casts a nostalgic eye back on the years of Ozzie and Harriet and the Hula Hoop, years which nonetheless paved the way for the turmoil of the decades to follow. From Sputnik to Elvis, bobby-socks to the Kinsey Report, DAVID HALBERTSTAM'S THE FIFTIES is a breathtaking collage of the people, music, memories, fads and issues that sent the first Baby Boomers on their way. Countless interviews, clips from landmark TV shows and movies and specially-produced music videos set to original '50's hits capture the intense tapestry of optimism and fear, repression and discovery that was THE FIFTIES.\n\n\nEpisode 5 - The Rage Within\n\nWith racial unrest on the rise, black Americans begin to fight back winning social acceptance with star athletes like Willie Mays and Bill Russell. But it's the schocking murder of 14 year old Emmett Till, the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Little Rock, Arkansas school desegragation nightmare that will kick the modern civil rights movement into high gear. The time had come for America to examine the color of it's soul.\n\n\n\nVideo \nVHSRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 53mn 57s \nBit rate : 3 523 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.383 \nStream size : 1.33 GiB (95%) \nWriting library : XviD 73 \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 53mn 57s \nSource duration : 53mn 57s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 192 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 74.1 MiB (5%) \nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame) \nWriting library : LAME3.98.4 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f11e4b1e838fb60b8d957a5d6bb4d53e7f99264","amp;dn":"History+Channel+-+David+Halberstam%27s+The+Fifties+%281997%29+-+Pt.+5+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f11e4b1e838fb60b8d957a5d6bb4d53e7f99264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,17,228,177,232,56,251,96,184,217,87,165,214,187,77,83,231,249,146,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
