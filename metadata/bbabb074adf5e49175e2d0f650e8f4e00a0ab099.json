Caught between the insane orders of the Nazi high command and the overwhelming numbers of Russian soldiers, Sven and his mates fight on regardless. They hate Hitler and Stalin in equal measure and will do anything to survive the inferno. Described as 'a novel of atrocity' when first published in English, WHEELS OF TERROR is a remorseless ride through a man-made Hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbabb074adf5e49175e2d0f650e8f4e00a0ab099","amp;dn":"Wheels+of+Terror+-+Hassel+Sven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbabb074adf5e49175e2d0f650e8f4e00a0ab099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,171,176,116,173,245,228,145,117,226,208,246,80,232,244,224,10,10,176,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
