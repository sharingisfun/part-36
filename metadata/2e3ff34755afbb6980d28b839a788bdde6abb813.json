The group comprises Tony Andreason (lead guitar), Dan Winslow (guitar/ vocals), Bob Reed (bass), and Steve Wahrer (drums/vocals). Unfairly depicted as a novelty act, the Trashmen were in actuality a top-notch rock &amp; roll combo, enormously popular on the teen club circuit, playing primarily surf music to a landlocked Minnesota audience. Drummer Steve Wahrer combined two songs by the Rivingtons (&quot;The Bird's the Word&quot; and &quot;Pa Pa Ooh Mow Mow&quot;), added freakish vocal effects and a pounding rhythm to the mix, and, by early 1964, the group was in the Top Ten nationwide with &quot;Surfin' Bird.&quot; Though the group continued to release great follow-up singles and an excellent album, their moment in the sun had come and gone; they disbanded by late 1967/early 1968. They re-formed in the mid-'80s and continued to play locally until Wahrer's death. The Trashmen are revered by '60s collectors as one of the great American teen band combos of all time, their lone hit exemplifying wild, unabashed rock &amp; roll at its most demented, bare-bones-basic, lone-E-chord finest.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-trashmen-p5686/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-trashmen-p5686/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Heather Phares):\n\nTube City!: The Best of The Trashmen adds their Garrett singles to their lone 1964 album Surfin' Bird. That classic single is here in all of its raw, unfettered glory, and while it does tend to overshadow the rest of the Trashmen's output, the collection shows that their other work was also strong. Their covers of &quot;Miserlou,&quot; &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; and &quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot; reflect the band's roots, and aren't overly respectful of the original versions, while &quot;My Woodie&quot; and &quot;Kuk&quot; are respectable surf-pop songs. The Trashmen's instrumentals also fare well, particularly &quot;Tube City&quot; itself , the flamenco-surf of &quot;Malaguena,&quot; and &quot;Bird Dance,&quot; a silly, tiki-bird infested bid to follow up the success of &quot;Surfin' Bird.&quot; &quot;Bird Dance Beat&quot; follows suit, but songs like &quot;Bad News,&quot; &quot;Whoa! Dad,&quot; and &quot;Real Live Doll&quot; have as much energy, but a little more originality. While it's not as complete as the four-disc box Bird Call!: The Twin City Stomp of the Trashmen, Tube City!: The Best of The Trashmen is still the definitive look at the first part of their career.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-tube-city-the-best-of-the-trashmen-r20408&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-tube-city-the-best-of-the-trashmen-r20408&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003H0D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003H0D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
