He worked with bebop legends Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. In the mid 1950's he formed a group with Horace Silver with which he would be associated for the next 35 years: the Jazz Messengers. The Messengers were formed as a collective of contemporaries, but over the years the band became known as an incubator for young talent, including such luminaries as Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter and Wynton Marsalis. The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz calls the Jazz Messengers &quot;the archetypal hard-bop group of the late '50s...&quot;\n\nAn absolutely wonderful 1961 set from Blakey and company, who demonstrate here how to be note-perfect without leeching away the emotion of a performance. Aside from Blakey's divine drum work, the standouts include Jaymie Merritt's trippy bass fingerwork and Wayne Shorter blowing his heart out on tenor sax. \n\nFor the liner notes, change the .pdfX extension into .pdf\n\nHDtracks PCM-24Bit-96Khz-FLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec813452ace52b8018e25a0aeef1ea94928a87f","amp;dn":"Art+Blakey+-+Art+Blakey%21+Jazz+Messengers%21+%281961%29+HDtracks+24-96-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eec813452ace52b8018e25a0aeef1ea94928a87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,200,19,69,42,206,82,184,1,142,37,160,174,239,30,169,73,40,168,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
