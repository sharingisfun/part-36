What can its fate tell us about our own cities, our own society? To find out, join narrator Harrison Ford on an exploration of the mysteries of our planet's biological diversity. \n\nTunnel into a metropolis of micro-organisms beneath New York, swim through the kelp forests of the Pacific, and climb to the top of the mysterious mountains in Venezuela that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World. Discover the wondrous relationships of living things, explore humanity's interconnectedness with nature, and gain insight into the puzzle of human survival itself.\n\n                           &lt;---------------------&gt;\n\nActor Harrison Ford,convinced to participate because of his passion for environmental issues, narrates in a likeably laconic manner. Lost Worlds was filmed on location in Guatemala, Quebec, New York, California, and Venezuela, and the sequence set among the last's table-top mountains--particularly the alien terrain of Mount Roraima and breathtaking Angel Falls--is the highlight (and also the inspiration behind Conan Doyle's novel).\n\n\n\nNARRATED BY:  Harrison Ford\n---------------------------\n\n\n\nH264:\n-----\n\n\n\nTitle: Lost Worlds-Life In The Balance \nYear:  2001\nFile Size: 350 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:39:57\nVideo Codec: H264\nVideo Resolution: 624x464\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1198 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 122 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (External English)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264809/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264809/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: I have reached the totaly ammount of bandwidth at my regular image \n-------------\n              site.
