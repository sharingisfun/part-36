The story takes place on a film set in a small British town in the 1950s. Elizabeth Taylor plays a washed-up actress trying to make a comeback but is plagued by a mysterious incident from her past. Unfortunately for her mental state, a collection of murders jar the quiet village where the movie is being made. Miss Marple arrives on the scene with her nephew, Inspector Craddock (Edward Fox), to investigate. In addition to Taylor, an assortment of other movie stars grace the roster of suspects, including Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : The.Mirror.Crackd.1980.720p.BluRay.AVC.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 954 Kbps\nLength            : 5.16 GiB for 1h 46mn 14s 785ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 690 (1.855) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #3           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : it\n\nText #4           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #5           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #6           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : da\n\nText #7           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : fi\n\nText #8           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : no\n\nText #9           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : sv\n\nText #10           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : nl\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081163/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081163/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70aaf2eec9b3b58267ceb0b1332e4bee2de244af","amp;dn":"The.Mirror.Crackd.1980.720p.BluRay.AVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70aaf2eec9b3b58267ceb0b1332e4bee2de244af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,170,242,238,201,179,181,130,103,206,176,177,51,46,75,238,45,226,68,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
