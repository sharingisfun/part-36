Sometimes more powerful, longer, or less controlled than the male orgasm.\r\n\r\nFACT:\r\nThe new TRIGASM TECHNIQUE, the heart of my new â€œOrgasmic Addictionâ€ program, has been described as â€˜The Holy Grail of Sexâ€™, â€˜The Ultimate In Sexual Pleasureâ€™, and a student inspired the name for this course â€“ â€˜Itâ€™s Like Sexual Addiction â€“ You Just Canâ€™t Get Enoughâ€™!\r\n\r\nSo, letâ€™s put those facts together.\r\n\r\n- Men believe that itâ€™s hard to give a woman an orgasmâ€¦\r\n\r\n- But women PROVE thatâ€™s not the case, that they can be even better than the male orgasm, and that they can even be strong enough to cause sexual addiction!\r\n\r\nSo What Is The TRIGASM â€“ And Why Do You Need To Learn To Master It?\r\nSimple.\r\n\r\nThe TRIGASM is a combination of THREE separate erogenous zones on your wife or girlfriendâ€™s body.\r\n\r\nWhen stimulated one at a time, these can lead to orgasm. Thatâ€™s great. Women love orgasms, believe me.\r\n\r\nBut hereâ€™s the big newsâ€¦\r\n\r\nIt turns out that when stimulated TOGETHER, they can cause your partnerâ€™s body to erupt with an orgasmic force like a massive volcano!\r\n\r\nBut the TRIGASM isnâ€™t just an orgasm times three.\r\n\r\nWomen have described it to me as ten, twenty, fifty times as powerful as a single, traditional orgasm. They say that the combination of these three centers of pleasure climaxing at the same time is the most mind-blowing experience of their life.\r\n\r\nAnd THAT Is What Can Create Sexual Addictionâ€¦\r\nWhich is not a bad thing!\r\n\r\nIn this context, sexual addiction merely means that your wife or girlfriend can quickly become absolutely addicted to having sex with you. Not with anyone else â€“ theyâ€™ll never LOOK at another man the same way â€“ but with YOU.\r\n\r\nThat means more sex for youâ€¦\r\n\r\n- More willingness to try new thingsâ€¦\r\n\r\n- More focus on your needsâ€¦\r\n\r\nAnd Iâ€™ve even heard that some male research subjects had better, stronger orgasms themselves, just from knowing what they were doing to the women!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a7f84edf4dfb9c9bfbf2518a2eace22301d183","amp;dn":"Orgasmic-Addiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a7f84edf4dfb9c9bfbf2518a2eace22301d183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,167,248,78,223,77,251,156,155,251,242,81,138,46,172,226,35,1,209,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
