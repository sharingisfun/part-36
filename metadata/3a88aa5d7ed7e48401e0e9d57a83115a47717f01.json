This was uploaded earlier on by a first time uploader, but the torrent went 404, not sure why, but the uploader made a rar file of an exe which was the same size extracted, that's usually sus, so MODs pulled it, which is fair enough for saftey sake. I installed it using Comodos sandbox to be safe, &amp; scanned the installed folder, the game is clean, since the original torrent is dead, and it's a good puzzle game, I re-uploaded this for you guys.\n\n\nI have made a new installer for this game since not everybody uses sandbox to install.\nJust run the installer, then use the shortcut to start the game.\n\nFYI: This game is timed, and gets hard, if you have a short fuse, this might not be fun a game for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a88aa5d7ed7e48401e0e9d57a83115a47717f01","amp;dn":"Golden+Cube+PC+Puzzle+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a88aa5d7ed7e48401e0e9d57a83115a47717f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,136,170,93,126,215,228,132,1,224,233,213,122,131,17,90,71,113,127,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
