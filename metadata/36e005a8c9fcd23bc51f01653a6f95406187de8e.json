Tucker and Dale are two best friends on vacation at their dilapidated mountain house, who are mistaken for murderous backwoods hillbillies by a group of obnoxious, preppy college kids. When one of the students gets separated from her friends, the boys try to lend a hand, but as the misunderstanding grows, so does the body count. TUCKER AND DALE VS EVIL has been a hit on the festival circuit, debuting at Sundance, and winning the Midnight Audience Award at SXSW, the Jury Prize for First Feature at Fantasia, the Best Director award at Fantaspoa, and the Best Motion Picture Award at Sitges.\n\nGenre: Horror, Comedy\n\nDirector: Eli Craig\n\nCast: Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nVideo: Xvid 1920x800 23.98fps\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 320kbps\n___________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e005a8c9fcd23bc51f01653a6f95406187de8e","amp;dn":"Tucker+and+Dale+vs+Evil.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e005a8c9fcd23bc51f01653a6f95406187de8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,224,5,168,201,252,210,59,197,31,1,101,58,111,149,64,97,135,222,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
