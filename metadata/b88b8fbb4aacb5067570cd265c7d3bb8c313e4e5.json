Nye\n\nAfter 1776, the former American colonies began to reimagine themselves as a unified, self-created community. Technologies had an important role in the resulting national narratives, and a few technologies assumed particular prominence. Among these were the axe, the mill, the canal, the railroad, and the irrigation dam. \n\nIn this book David Nye explores the stories that clustered around these technologies. In doing so, he rediscovers an American story of origins, with America conceived as a second creation built in harmony with God's first creation.\n\nWhile mainstream Americans constructed technological foundation stories to explain their place in the New World, however, marginalized groups told other stories of destruction and loss. Native Americans protested the loss of their forests, fishermen resisted the construction of dams, and early environmentalists feared the exhaustionof resources.\n\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88b8fbb4aacb5067570cd265c7d3bb8c313e4e5","amp;dn":"America+as+Second+Creation+by+David+E.+Nye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88b8fbb4aacb5067570cd265c7d3bb8c313e4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,139,143,187,74,172,181,6,117,112,205,38,92,125,59,184,195,19,228,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
