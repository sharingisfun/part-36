It was directed by Alistair Hope and produced by Jonathan Court and Oli Smith.\n\nPart of the Alien series, the game is set in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years prior to Aliens. The game follows Amanda, who is investigating the disappearance of her mother Ellen Ripley. Amanda is transferred to the space station Sevastopol to find the flight recorder of the Nostromo only to discover an Alien has terrorized the station and killed the vast majority of the crew.\n\nAlien: Isolation gained favourable reviews from critics, and is notable for receiving a much more positive reaction than Sega's previous Alien games such as Aliens vs. Predator and Aliens: Colonial Marines.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrom: ps3repack.net\nRegion: [EU] NPEB01921\nRelease by: Fugazi\nSize: 9.26 GB + 401 MB + (dlc) 720 MB\nLanguage: Eng, Fra, Spa, Ger, Ita, Rus, (text Pol)\nVersion: 1.01\n\n1.
