The first movie Vampire Hunter D (original), and the second movie Vampire Hunter D (Bloodlust).\n\nAbout this Series:\n\nIn a future where blood-thirsty werewolves and mutants roam the countryside killing anyone foolish enough to leave the protection of city walls, the only hope for humans are the Vampire Hunters. When a young woman is bitten by a powerful vampire lord she hires a Vampire Hunter named &amp;#039;D&amp;#039; who is particularly suited for battling demons... \n\nRelease Notes:\n\nWhen darkness falls, the hunt begins. D has been hired to track down Meier Link, a notoriously powerful vampire who has abducted a human woman, Charlotte Elbourne. D&amp;#039;s order are strict - find Charlotte, at any cost. For the first time, D faces serious competition. The Markus Brothers, a family of Vampire Hunters, were hired for the same bounty. D must intercept Meier and conquer hostile forces on all sides in a deadly race against time. Despised by Vampires for his profession and by Humans for the blood in his veins, D relentlessly pursues his prey for a price. &quot;...An Apocalyptic Epic.&quot; DAILY HERALD - Dann Gire, &quot;...A visual poetry that&amp;#039;s refreshing.&quot; VARIETY - Derek Elley\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:905a84dacbda25f87c281c5dab22026f61d65d3f","amp;dn":"VAMPIRE.HUNTER.D.COLLECTION.2002.FS.COMPLETE.DVDR-M37H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"905a84dacbda25f87c281c5dab22026f61d65d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,90,132,218,203,218,37,248,124,40,28,93,171,34,2,111,97,214,93,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
