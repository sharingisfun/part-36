The\nfilm stars Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Savage, John Cazale, and\nGeorge Dzundza. The story takes place in Clairton, a small working class town on the\nMonongahela River south of Pittsburgh and then in Vietnam, somewhere in the woodland and\nin Saigon, during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe film was based in part on a screenplay called The Man Who Came To Play by Louis\nGarfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker about Las Vegas and Russian Roulette. Producer Michael\nDeeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric\nWashburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian Roulette element and placing it in the\nVietnam War. The film went over budget and over schedule and ended up costing $15\nmillion.\n\nThe scenes of Russian roulette, while highly controversial on release, have been viewed as a\nmetaphor for the Vietnam War itself. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best\nPicture and Best Director and was named by the American Film Institute as the 53rd Greatest\nMovie of All Time on the 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI's 100 YearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦100 Movies list.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66883373325221071891.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66883373325221071891.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91696523771184641295.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91696523771184641295.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/58163356921113330600.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/58163356921113330600.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57171920937038659047.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57171920937038659047.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/31708539549371300982.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/31708539549371300982.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/04216050442271918868.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/04216050442271918868.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirected by Michael Cimino\n\nProduced by Barry Spikings\nMichael Deeley\nMichael Cimino\nJohn Peverall\n\nScreenplay by Deric Washburn\n\nStory by Quinn K.
