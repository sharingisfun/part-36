And he will be cleaning up after it.&quot;\n\n\n\nZero Girl\nFive-issue mini-series published by Homage Comics (an imprint of DC) in 2001.\n&quot;The plot concerns high school student Amy Smootster, and her attempts to start a relationship with her guidance counselor Tim. Another plot thread follows her relationship with circles and squares---it seems that circular objects tend to help or defend her, while squares try to hurt her. All of this has something to do with her feet producing copious but never-defined fluid when she feels shame.&quot;\n\n\nZero Girl - Full Circle\nIt was published in 2003 by Homage Comics as well.\n&quot;This was a five-issue follow-up story (to Zero Girl), set fifteen years later, called Zero Girl: Full Circle, which put Amy and Tim in the background and focused on Tim's daughter, Nikki.&quot;\n\n\n\nFour Women\nIt was released from late 2001 to early 2002 by Homage Comics.\n&quot;Four Women is an American five-part limited series. Written and drawn by Sam Kieth, it deals with four female friends of varying ages -- Donna, Bev, Marion and Cindy -- and a road trip during which they are attacked and sexually assaulted by two men. The story mostly takes place in a flashback as Donna recounts the story to her psychiatrist.&quot;\n\n\n\nWolverine Hulk\nFour issue mini-series published by Marvel Comics in 2002\nIn this series, Hulk and Wolverine get in charge of a mysterious girl who suddenly pops up in their lives. Of course, this means trouble is soon to follow.\n\n\n\nOJO\nFive-issue mini-series published by ONI Press in the late 2004 and early 2005.\nIn this mini, Kieth has help from Alex Pardee and Chris Wisnia with the illustrations.\n&quot;Annie has terrible luck with pets. She's killed hamsters and mice and lizards and birds. For a domesticated animal, getting Annie as an owner is akin to a death sentence. But when Annie finds a little beastie named Ojo in a drain pipe, has her karma really changed or is she destined for more disappointment?&quot;\n\n\n\nScratch\nFive-issue mini-series published by DC in 2004.\n&quot;Scratch is a five issue mini-series, written and drawn by Kieth. The story centers on a werewolf named Scratch who lives in a small town which finds a number of children have gone missing. Naturally, because he's the local freak, Scratch is fingered as the main suspect, but the story's not quite that simple, naturally. Oh, and a certain Dark Knight is set to make an appearance.&quot;\n\n\n\nMy Inner Bimbo\nFive-issue mini-series published by ONI Press in 2007/2008.\nIssues 2-5 are co-illustrated by Josh Hagler.\n&quot;There are two sides to every coin, every story, and every person. No matter how hard you try to hide that second face away, you can never get rid of it. That's what one man is about to learn when his under-developed feminine side materializes into a very real bubble gum-chewing bimbo and turns his world upside down!&quot;\n\n\n\nBatman Lobo - Deadly Serious\nTwo-issue mini-series published by DC in 2007. While it's two issues, they are in prestige format, so each comic is 48 pages.\nThat would be the equivalent of a regular four-issue mini.\n&quot;Sam Kieth, Batman, Lobo, Spaceships, Alien disease that makes women turn into homicidal maniacs, explosions, lots of guns, aliens. As long as you arenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t expecting a super serious Batman story, this is made of 100% win. Batman, against his will, is brought to a spaceship light years from earth to stop a disease that makes women act out and go on insane killing sprees. All the men have left the ship and so all of these women are being killed. KiethÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s women are, of course, beautiful and the story is fun as well as morbidly funny. Of course, Lobo just happens to be there for some reason, trying to make some money.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d0f57da67bb1bd0dc94b83dd15f1762c2a05a0","amp;dn":"Sam+Kieth+miniseries+%28Zero+Girl-OJO-Four+Women...%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d0f57da67bb1bd0dc94b83dd15f1762c2a05a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,208,245,125,166,123,177,189,13,201,75,131,221,21,241,118,44,42,5,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
