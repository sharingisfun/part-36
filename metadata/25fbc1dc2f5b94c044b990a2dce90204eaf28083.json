Cryptic and spartan, the set continues in the eclectic vein of recent efforts, but with greater clarity and focus, resulting in an intriguingly diffuse collection ranging from the Serge Gainsbourg-esque pop of &quot;Dance Me to the End of Love&quot; to the boozy, country-inflected &quot;The Captain.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25fbc1dc2f5b94c044b990a2dce90204eaf28083","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Various+Positions+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25fbc1dc2f5b94c044b990a2dce90204eaf28083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,251,193,220,47,91,148,192,68,185,144,162,220,233,2,4,234,242,128,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
