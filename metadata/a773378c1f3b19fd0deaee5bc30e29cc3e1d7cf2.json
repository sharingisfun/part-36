These people are called baby-boomers, and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the same people who are bankrupting Social Security and invented the male ponytail.\n\nBlender has never bought the myth that rock &amp; roll declined at middle age; the last 25 years were as good as the 25 before them, unless you somehow think Eminem and U2 arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t as Genius Level as the Moody Blues and Captain &amp; Tennille. So weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve constructed an alternative rock history that begins long after Woodstock stopped smelling bad and the Sex Pistols quit with dignity, a list of the 500 greatest songs since 1980. And believe us, it was hard to stop at only 500. Sometimes, the good olÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ days were yesterday and today.&quot;\n\nDownload, seed and enjoy!\nReleased by ToiletClown @ thepiratebay.se/user/ToiletClown","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a773378c1f3b19fd0deaee5bc30e29cc3e1d7cf2","amp;dn":"500+Greatest+Songs+Since+You+Were+Born+--+Blender+Magazine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a773378c1f3b19fd0deaee5bc30e29cc3e1d7cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,115,55,140,31,59,25,253,13,234,238,91,195,14,41,204,62,29,124,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
