In this video you'll see pasture land converted into a blossoming terrace, within a few weeks.\nThere is a lot of good information here as to how to create a garden or farm that essentially takes care of itself, after you first do the work of setting it up.\n\nSepp Holzer's childhood dream has been realised. His Krameterhof has become a Garden of Eden. A garden whose inhabitants, animal and vegetable,\nare like a team ? his team, supporting each other.\n\nFor 40 years the Holzers have farmed 45 hectares of mountainside. Remarkably they produce cereals, vegetables and fruit at altitudes up to 1500 metres.\nThe key to their success? ...permaculture - farming in harmony with nature. Unlike monoculture, it produces healthy crops, free of chemical residues.\nBut at the same time it enriches the soil - naturally.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdad0f7996b9222ead249f5aae05d92ff2341ae0","amp;dn":"sepp+holzer+permakultur+en%2Cde%2C+ru%2Ch%2Cit%2Cfr%2Cpl%2Ce%2C.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdad0f7996b9222ead249f5aae05d92ff2341ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,173,15,121,150,185,34,46,173,36,159,90,174,5,217,47,242,52,26,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
