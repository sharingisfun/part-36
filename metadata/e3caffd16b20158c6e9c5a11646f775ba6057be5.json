Nye, &quot;Technology Matters: Questions to Live With&quot;\nThe MIT Press | 2007 | ISBN: 0262640678 | 304 pages | PDF\n\nTechnology can seem like an implacable force that gathers power as it advances and abruptly transforms society. But Nye, a scholar who carefully studies the symbiotic relationship between humankind and its tools, observes that creating tools and technologies has always been intrinsic to being human, and that while it seems as though we're being controlled by technology, we are in fact making choices about which technologies we embrace and how we use them. In an accessible narrative spiked with clarion examples and nimble interpretations, Nye poses a series of leading questions that guide readers to a more accurate perception of the unintended, unpredictable, and serendipitous evolution and impact of technology. How does technology influence how we interact with nature, how we care for ourselves, and how we learn and work? Are our technologies improving our lives or limiting our horizons and endangering our very existence? The issues pertaining to the role of technology on earth are complex and ever more urgent, and Nye provides an invaluably methodical and provocative primer. Donna Seaman\nReview\n&quot;A deeply informed historian who writes with impressive clarity, David Nye persuades us in Technology Matters that we should ask the kind of life-shaping questions about technology that we customarily pose about politics and economics. He does not finally answer the timely questions that he explicates, but provokes us to search for our own answers.&quot; - Thomas P. Hughes, author of Human-Built World: How to Think about Technology and Culture&quot;\n\n&quot;Technology Matters provides a scintillating and sweeping assessment of how technology and culture have shaped one another over time and how humanity's future will be shaped by the choices we make today. Nye's latest analysis of the reciprocal interplay of technology and culture extends his more academic work to a broader audience and does so in a clear and engaging manner.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jeffrey K. Stine, National Museum of American History\n\n&quot;A deeply informed historian who writes with impressive clarity, David Nye persuades us in Technology Matters that we should ask the kind of life-shaping questions about technology that we customarily pose about politics and economics. He does not finally answer the timely questions that he explicates, but provokes us to search for our own answers.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Thomas P. Hughes, author of Human-Built World: How to Think about Technology and Culture\n\n&quot;Applying the lessons of history to modern-day dilemmas, Nye defies much common wisdom about the power of technology in society. With irony and wit, he exhorts us not to succumb to defeatist notions of technological determinism but to take charge of our own human destinies.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Arthur Molella, Director, Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, Smithsonian Institution\n\n&quot;In the field of technology studies, David Nye stands out for his ability to distill complex issues into concise frameworks. This book masterfully crystallizes debates about the social and cultural impact of technology into ten questions that in their very asking demonstrate how philosophical concerns about technology are, as always, concerns about ourselves.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Marita Sturken, Associate Professor, Department of Culture and Communication, New York University ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3caffd16b20158c6e9c5a11646f775ba6057be5","amp;dn":"Technology+Matters+-+Questions+to+Live+With+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3caffd16b20158c6e9c5a11646f775ba6057be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,202,255,209,107,32,21,140,110,156,90,17,100,111,119,91,166,5,123,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
