I have made my life a blade, and His heart is my sheath....So pledges Gilly, vowing to destroy Macbeth, the most powerful man in medieval Scotland. She escapes from the hut in Birnam Wood in which she has lived for the past seven years, ever since she was taken in by Nettle and Mad Helga -- wise women whose powers are widely feared and reviled. Disguising herself as a servant boy, Gilly finds work in the kitchen of her enemy's castle. Soon she insinuates herself into the lives of Macbeth and his beautiful, dangerous wife, subtly manipulating the forces governing their fate. But as Gilly moves closer to her private revenge, she finds herself at risk when she confronts the startling legacy of a long-concealed heritage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30bf1f3150d554502f3849d3e3b37bbe8e6cda13","amp;dn":"The+Third+Witch+-+Rebecca+Reisert.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30bf1f3150d554502f3849d3e3b37bbe8e6cda13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,191,31,49,80,213,84,80,47,56,73,211,227,179,123,190,142,108,218,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
