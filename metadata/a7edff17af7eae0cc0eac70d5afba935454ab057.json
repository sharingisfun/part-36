By way of green text that appears on the surface of the sphere, Gantz informs those present that their lives have ended. The following words appear on the black sphere's surface: &quot;Your lives have ended. What you do with your new lives is entirely up to me. That's the theory, anyway.&quot;\n\nWithout explaining anything to them, the Gantz sphere opens up to reveal a bald man on life support in the center, and three racks that offer various items for them to use.\nInformation on the Gantz Targets appear on the surface of the sphere, shortly before the Gantz Team are transported to the location of the mission, where they are expected to kill aliens. Gantz gives out individual suits for each person there, giving them great strength, speed, jumping ability, and protection from harm. Additional weapons and items are gained from the hundred point menu.\n\nThe hunters cannot return from their mission until all enemies have been killed, or the time limit has run out. If the mission is successful, each individual is awarded points for the aliens they have killed. They are then allowed to leave, and live their lives as they see fit, Gantz summoning them back again when its time for the next mission. The only way to stop having to participate in the missions is to earn one hundred points, and choose the option to be freed. While in the anime version, there are four targets, including a &quot;Kurono alien&quot;, at present, there have been nine different types of alien targets in the manga\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7edff17af7eae0cc0eac70d5afba935454ab057","amp;dn":"GANTZ+%28TWIZ%29+UNCUT+COMPLETE+SERIES+%28ENG+DUB%29+NO+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7edff17af7eae0cc0eac70d5afba935454ab057","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,237,255,23,175,126,174,12,192,234,199,13,90,251,169,53,69,74,176,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
