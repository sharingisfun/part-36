AZW3, EPUB and MOBI formats\n\nFiction with sprinklings of truth. Tags: Australia, England, Humor, Poetry\n\nPAM AYRES is well known in the UK and Australia for her humorous poetry. She has been a regular on television and radio since winning the TV talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in 1975.  She is one of Britain's best-loved entertainers, and was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 2004.\n\nHonest, hilarious and occasionally poignant, Pam's humorous verse deftly exposes the absurdities of everyday life and continues to delight fans of all ages around the world.\n\nThe Works contains 120 of Pam Ayres' best-known poems from the 1970s and 1980s, including: \n\nThe Battery Hen; \nPlease Will You Take Your Children Home Before I Do Them In?; \nSling Another Chair Leg on the Fire, Mother; \nOh, I Wish I'd Looked After Me Teeth.\n \nFor this edition, Pam has written a general introduction, as well as individual introductions to the poems, many of which are now illustrated with specially commissioned line drawings by Susan Hellard. \n\nMy previous Pam Ayres torrent contains another three poems that aren't duplicated in this bigger book: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11072478/Bill_Spinks_Bedstead_-_Pam_Ayres&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11072478/Bill_Spinks_Bedstead_-_Pam_Ayres&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThese two books are all my Pam Ayres.
