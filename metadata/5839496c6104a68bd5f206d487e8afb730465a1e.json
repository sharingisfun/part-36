Is there good and evil, and should we care? How do we know what's true anyway? And can we make any sense of this universe, or our own lives?\n\nSense and Goodness answers all these questions in lavish detail, without complex jargon. A complete worldview is presented and defended, covering every subject from knowledge to art, from metaphysics to morality, from theology to politics. Topics include free will, the nature of the universe, the meaning of life, and much more, arguing from scientific evidence that there is only a physical, natural world without gods or spirits, but that we can still live a life of love, meaning, and joy.\n\nAuthor: Richard Carrier\nPublisher: Authorhouse\nPublication: February 23, 2005\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5839496c6104a68bd5f206d487e8afb730465a1e","amp;dn":"Richard+Carrier+-+Sense+and+Goodness+Without+God+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5839496c6104a68bd5f206d487e8afb730465a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,57,73,108,97,4,166,139,213,242,6,212,135,232,175,183,48,70,90,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
