Additionally, there are chapters devoted to massive nanostructured materials and composites and covering basic properties and requirements of this new class of engineering materials. Especially the issues concerning stability, reliability and mechanical performance are mandatory aspects that need to be regarded carefully for any nanostructured engineering material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2100486440e55b194362fc72a96e27e12692c5a","amp;dn":"Nanostructured+Materials+-+Gerhard+Wilde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2100486440e55b194362fc72a96e27e12692c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,16,4,134,68,14,85,177,148,54,47,199,42,150,226,126,18,105,44,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
