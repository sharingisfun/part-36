Honey Deal, Walter's American wife,\ndoesn't know that Walter is a member of a spy ring and gives\nshelter to escaped German POWs. But she's tired of telling him\njokes he doesn't understandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it's time for a divorce.\n\nAlong comes Carl Webster, the Hot Kid of the Marshals Service. He's\nlooking for Jurgen Schrenk. Carl's pretty sure Walter's involved\nwith keeping Schrenk hidden so he gets to know Honey, hoping she'll\nlead him to Walter. Honey likes the hot kid marshal and doesn't\nmuch care that he's married. But all Carl wants is to get Jurgen\nwithout getting shot. Next, Carl meets Vera Mezwa, the Ukrainian\nhead of the spy ring, and her lover Bohdan, with a sly way of\nkilling. And then there's OttoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Waffen-SS major who runs away\nwith a nice Jewish girl. Elmore Leonard's worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½gritty, funny, and\nfull of surprises.\n\n----\n\nElmore Leonard has written more than three dozen critically\nacclaimed books during his highly successful career, including the\nbestsellers, The Hot Kid, Mr. Paradise, Tishomingo Blues, Be Cool,\nGet Shorty and Rum Punch.
