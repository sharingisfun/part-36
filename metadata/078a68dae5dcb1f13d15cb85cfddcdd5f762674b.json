Aidan Quinn also stars, and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.\n\nThe film is perhaps best known for Depp's humorous physical comedy routines (which are based on silent film comics Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd) and for popularizing, in the United States, the song &quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; by The Proclaimers.[citation needed]\n\nBenny &amp; Joon was shot primarily on location in Spokane, Washington, while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near Metaline Falls, Washington.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078a68dae5dcb1f13d15cb85cfddcdd5f762674b","amp;dn":"Benny+%26amp%3B+Joon+%281993%29+DVD5+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078a68dae5dcb1f13d15cb85cfddcdd5f762674b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,138,104,218,229,220,177,241,61,21,203,133,207,221,205,213,247,98,103,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
