The Things You Do\n\n\nSteve Plater - Cigar Box Guitar, guitar, stomp percussion.\nMarion Turner - Vocals, Harmonica.\n\nThe word Blues is all over the music industry, due to acts such as the John Spencer Blues Explosion, The White Stripes and the Black Keys, amongst many others, bringing a sound to the world that they announce as the blues. But while these artists proclaim the influence and inspiration of the great Blues men and women, very few actually ground themselves in the actual playing of the Blues. Not so with Salty Dog - Steve and Marion not only explore the history of the Blues, they learn it, absorb it and rework it.\n\nHere are the songs of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Hound Dog Taylor, Jessie Mae Hemphill amongst others, all performed in the unique style that Steve and Marion bring to their craft.\n\nTo aid the authenticity of their sound, Steve is now performing the songs on a Didley Bow, the 3 string guitar type instrument made from cigar box that was the actual instrument on which much early Blues was performed. And Marion just grows in stature with every recording, both on harmonica and vocal. She is now most definitely AustraliaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹s leading female Blues harmonica player. Take this album as, not just the authentic entertainment that it is, but also as the work of 2 people who have studied and explored the Blues, and who bring you, the listener, the results of that search. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b0c536afa2b6307cb8c433310a2b2fab5c0ba5","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Salty+Dog+-+Jack+Of+Diamonds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b0c536afa2b6307cb8c433310a2b2fab5c0ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,176,197,54,175,162,182,48,124,184,196,51,49,10,43,47,171,92,11,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
