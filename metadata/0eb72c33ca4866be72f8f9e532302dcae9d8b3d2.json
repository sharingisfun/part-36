Deranged by their own studies, the Nazi scientists have been\ndifficult to find, much less talk to. Only the linguist Susan Gilbert has\nhad any luck getting their cooperation. When it turns out that the biggest,\nmost horrific experiment of them all has yet to be completed, she ends up\nleading the effort to save the world. But she's not a mad genius, not a\nsecret agent, and not even in the military, and the only man with the\nknowledge to help her succeed is her own worst enemy, a remorseless,\nmanipulative villain hunted by the Allies, the Nazis, and supernatural\nmonsters alike.\n\n\n\nA dark fantasy based on the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Astronomy is\nRichard Wadholm's debut novel. Richard's fiction has been published several\ntimes in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, and his story\n&quot;Green Tea,&quot; which appeared in Asimov's Year's Best anthology, was nominated\nfor a Theodore Sturgeon Award","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb72c33ca4866be72f8f9e532302dcae9d8b3d2","amp;dn":"Astronomy+by+Richard+Wadholm+%5Bretail+EPUB%5D+%28MOBI+AZW3+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb72c33ca4866be72f8f9e532302dcae9d8b3d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,183,44,51,202,72,102,190,114,248,249,229,50,48,45,202,233,216,179,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
