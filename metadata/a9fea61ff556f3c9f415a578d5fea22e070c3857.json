Burnout reduces our productivity and saps our energy, leaving us overwhelmed by everyday tasks and feeling increasingly cynical and resentful. In this course, Todd Dewett helps you recognize some of the most common causes of burnout, such as long hours, too much travel, tight deadlines, and no vacation, so that you can figure out how to prevent stress from building up and help yourself recover.\r\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9fea61ff556f3c9f415a578d5fea22e070c3857","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Avoiding+Burnout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9fea61ff556f3c9f415a578d5fea22e070c3857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,254,166,31,245,86,243,201,244,21,165,120,213,254,162,46,7,12,56,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
