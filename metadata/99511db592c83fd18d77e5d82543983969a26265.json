It's a vital artery shuttling both cargo and people through a vast wilderness.\r\nHomesteaders living miles from roads or towns and surrounded by wild animals - from bears to moose and wolves - can flag the passenger train down in the middle of the woods. If it doesn't get through they can be stranded without supplies.\r\nCrews face a constant threat of deadly avalanches, blizzards, freezing temperatures and dangerous wildlife to keep this crucial lifeline running. Giant icicles, frozen switch points and broken rails must be taken care of to keep the line running.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Frozen Danger \r\nOff-grid settlers Jim, Nancy and John face being stranded without basic necessities when an avalanche hits and blocks the track. Roadmaster Hugh Evans battles freezing temperatures to get propane to the off-gridders before they literally freeze to death.\r\n\r\n2)  The Beast \r\nA devastating snowstorm blocks Alaska's lifeline. Danny and Animal to bring out the Beast, a 67 ton snowplough - and race to clear the way for a freight train hauling vital diesel to Seward. And homesteaders, Mary and Clyde, need an emergency generator.\r\n\r\n3)  Killer Ice \r\nWhen ice threatens to shut down the rails, pregnant off-gridder Amanda Simpson is left stranded while her friend seeks out supplies. Brakemen Danny and Animal must transport $5 million worth of freight to Anchorage, navigating a wild moose on the rails.\r\n\r\n4)  Disaster Trail \r\nOff the grid brothers, Steven and Jonathon, must fix a collapsing roof on their cabin before a life-threatening snowstorm. Brakemen, Danny and Animal, race to deliver military equipment to Anchorage when a car derails, threatening to shut down the line.\r\n\r\n5)  Ice Dagger \r\nHugh Evans finds a broken rail switch that threatens to derail a train and stop crucial medical supplies from getting through to homesteaders, Clyde and Mary Lovel, and Roadmaster Bruce must shoot down a twenty-ton icicle before it hits a train.\r\n\r\n6)  Spring Attacks \r\nWith the spring thaw comes floodwater that threatens to wash away a section of track that Roadmaster Bruce must race to repair. The spring also means bears, which pose a danger to settlers Jim and Nancy as they make their way to the passenger train.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Railroad-Alaska-Season-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CAVLC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3184 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 991 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.windfallfilms.com/show/2830/railroad-alaska-season-1.aspx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99511db592c83fd18d77e5d82543983969a26265","amp;dn":"Railroad+Alaska+Series+1+3of6+Killer+Ice+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99511db592c83fd18d77e5d82543983969a26265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,81,29,181,146,200,63,209,141,119,229,216,37,67,152,57,105,162,98,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
