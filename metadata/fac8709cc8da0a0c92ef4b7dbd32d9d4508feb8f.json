They don't care who they kill it seems \nas long as &quot;we think&quot; what they want us to.\n\nI never been a big believer in the 9/11 conspiracy, until I read this\nand now know for a fact the government does plan things like this.\nIt really gets me thinking.\n\nThis is the declassified document about the details of US government\nplanning to commit a terrorist attack on its own people.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout File:\n\nAccording to secret and long-hidden documents, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up and approved plans for what may be the most corrupt plan ever created by the U.S. government Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A FAKE TERRORIST ATTACK ON ITS OWN CITIZENS.\n\nCode named Operation Northwoods, the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war.\n\nOne idea seriously considered involved the launch of John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth. On February 20, 1962, Glenn was to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on his historic journey. The flight was to carry the banner of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virtues of truth, freedom, and democracy into orbit high over the planet. But Lemnitzer and his Chiefs had a different idea. They proposed to Lansdale that, should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the objective is to provide irrevocable proof that the fault lies with the Communists et al Cuba. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDocuments like these are hard to find.  Let me know you appreciate \nmy efforts by just leaving a comment, or suggestions, or even what\nyou think about this document.  I would really like to hear it from\nyou readers.\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fac8709cc8da0a0c92ef4b7dbd32d9d4508feb8f","amp;dn":"Gov+Terrorist+attack+on+own+Citizens+-+Operation+Northwoods+1962","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fac8709cc8da0a0c92ef4b7dbd32d9d4508feb8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,200,112,156,200,218,10,12,146,239,75,125,189,50,217,212,80,143,235,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
