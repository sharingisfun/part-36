From the hypnotic opener, a Purcell hornpipe, their collaboration works its way through an atmospheric series of traditional songs and instrumentals. Sweeney switches between Ã¯Â¬ï¿½ddle, viola, nyckelharpa and bagpipes, while the undemonstrative James adds ultra-discreet foot percussion. She brings a touch of girlish mischief to The FarmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cursed Wife, a tale of a scold who is too much even for the devil himself. Light a log Ã¯Â¬ï¿½re and let the musicians do the rest.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60f9084afb26cdf8b11730f25130481eff6f752e","amp;dn":"Hannah+James+and+Sam+Sweeney+-+State+and+Ancientry+%5B2012%5D+%5BAlbum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60f9084afb26cdf8b11730f25130481eff6f752e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,249,8,74,251,38,205,248,177,23,48,242,81,48,72,30,255,111,117,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
