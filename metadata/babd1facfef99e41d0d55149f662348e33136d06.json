Hitting BillboardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hot 100 chart in December of 1961, the tune Brown co-wrote with Gene Redd peaked at position #76. It appeared on the Christmas Singles chart for nine seasons, hitting #1 in 1972. It includes a number of characteristics of Christmas music, such as multiple references in the lyrics to the Christmas season and Christmas traditions, and the use of a church bell type sound, created using a piano, at the start of the song.\n\nBon Jovi covered and recorded the song for the A Very Special Christmas 2 compilation album, as well as a single. The album reached a chart position of #7 on the U.S. Billboard 200 charts in December of 1992. The single release also included the songs &quot;Back Door Santa&quot; and &quot;I Wish Every Day Could Be Like Christmas&quot; from the first A Very Special Christmas album.\n\nThe cover art pictures Jon Bon Jovi in an intimate embrace and near kiss with Cindy Crawford.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babd1facfef99e41d0d55149f662348e33136d06","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+Please+Come+Home+For+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babd1facfef99e41d0d55149f662348e33136d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,189,31,172,254,249,158,65,208,213,81,73,246,98,52,142,51,19,109,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
