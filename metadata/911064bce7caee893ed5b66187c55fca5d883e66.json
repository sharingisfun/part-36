Sub Pop first heard the band on an LP bought through the mail, the cover still hot from the KinkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s copier. And as that record (2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s No Sky (Oh My My)) demonstrated, JaillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vinnie Kircher is equally comfortable crafting songs that either amble up slyly, or tumble out pell mell, with lyrics that betray his English major background. SPIN said of ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s How We Burn, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What elevates their [Sub Pop] debut beyond your average twee-punk rager is the gentle psych dabblings: extra delay on a guitar solo, an errant Ã¢â‚¬Ëœooh-ahh-ooh,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a dubby Panda Bear flourish, and the swirling noise that murmurs through the background of the cheerful Ã¢â‚¬ËœSnake Shakes.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRecorded throughout 2011 in KircherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crummy, poorly lit basement, with minimal gear and a control room of thrift store afghans, and mixed at NYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rare Book Room by Nicolas Vernhes, JaillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest mangled masterpiece is entitled Traps. An acerbic exercise in both humility and aggression that transcends the humble environment of its creation, Traps finds the Milwaukee-based psych-pop three-piece confronting a malfunctioning universe with an inventive, lean and, dare we say, excellent 11-song album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911064bce7caee893ed5b66187c55fca5d883e66","amp;dn":"Jaill+-+Traps+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911064bce7caee893ed5b66187c55fca5d883e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,16,100,188,231,202,238,137,62,213,182,97,135,197,95,202,93,136,62,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
