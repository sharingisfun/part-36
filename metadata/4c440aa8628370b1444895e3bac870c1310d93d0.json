BUT YOU CAN SEE IT FROM HERE.\n \nIn the near future, with physical augmentation gaining ground and nano-cybernetics only years away, the dawn of limitless human evolution is just beyond the horizon, and a secret corporate cabal of ruthless men intends to make sure that humankind stays under its control. But two people on opposite sides of the world are starting to ask questions that could get them killed. \n\nSecret Service agent Anna Kelso has been suspended for investigating the shooting that claimed her partnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. Anna suspects that the head of a bio-augmentation firm was the real target, and against orders sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turned up a few leads concerning a covert paramilitary force and a cadre of underground hackers. But the cover-up runs deep, and now thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a target on her back. Meanwhile, Ben Saxon, former SAS officer turned mercenary, joins a shadowy special ops outfit. They say theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a force for good, but Saxon quickly learns that the truth is not so clear-cut. So begins a dangerous quest to uncover a deadly secret that will take him from Moscow to London, D.C. to Geneva, and to the dark truthÃ¢â‚¬â€if he lives that long.\n\nThe year is 2027; in a world consumed by chaos and conspiracy, two people are set on a collision course with the most powerful and dangerous organization in historyÃ¢â‚¬â€and the fate of humanity hangs in the balance.\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.
