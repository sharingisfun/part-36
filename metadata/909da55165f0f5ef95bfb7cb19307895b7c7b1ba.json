So the porcine behaviour on display in The 3 Little Pigs Ã¢â‚¬â€œcheating, lying, and all-around Peter Pan callousnessÃ¢â‚¬â€œis hardly unfamiliar stuff. However, the huffing and puffing is great fun to watch, and there are quite a few surprises when it comes to exactly how their houses get blown down.\n\nOf the three swinish siblings on display, the youngest and seemingly most easygoing is Christian (Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge), a handsome martial-arts instructor married to a hot cop (Julie Perreault) who is decidedly cool to his porn-addicted ways. His problems look simple compared with middle son Martin (Claude Legault), a horndog veering toward cheating on his terrific wife (Isabel Richer) simply because family life is so exhausting.\n\nThe most apparently stable son is the eldest, Remi (Paul Doucet), a successful banker married to the well-named Dominique (Sophie PrÃƒÂ©gent), who runs a tight ship at home. He lords his virtues over the other two, but the brothers share affectionate repartee and are pulled together by the sudden collapse of their mother (France Castel).\n\nHer hospital room is the site of their bawdy get-togethers, where various temptations are contemplated and they say things a comatose mother shouldn't have to hear. But no one appears to notice that her life signs are only normal when all her boys are in the room.\n\nWhat really engages in this big Quebec hit, a first-time directing venture for actor Patrick Huard (who wrote and costarred in Bon Cop, Bad Cop ), is the sober tone that creeps in just as the laughs are wearing off. Each principal gets a crack at narrating sometimes overlapping events, and this adds a bit more perspective. Without taking itself too seriously, this update of the Piggies saga offers interesting insights into modern notions of commitment. Anyway, it doesn't blow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909da55165f0f5ef95bfb7cb19307895b7c7b1ba","amp;dn":"Les+3+P%27tits+Cochons+-+2007+-+H264+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909da55165f0f5ef95bfb7cb19307895b7c7b1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,157,165,81,101,240,245,239,149,191,183,203,25,48,120,149,183,199,177,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
