Offit, &quot;Killing Us Softly: The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine&quot;\nISBN: 0007491727 | 2013 | EPUB\n\nDr. Offit reveals how alternative medicineÃ¢â‚¬â€an unregulated industry under no legal obligation to prove its claims or admit its risksÃ¢â‚¬â€can actually be harmful to our health.\n\nUsing dramatic real-life stories, Offit separates the sense from the nonsense, showing why any therapyÃ¢â‚¬â€alternative or traditionalÃ¢â‚¬â€should be scrutinized. He also shows how some nontraditional methods can do a great deal of good, in some cases exceeding therapies offered by conventional practitioners.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac0297dffda9f7b0437037715fe0ab62fb791a0","amp;dn":"Killing+Us+Softly%3A+The+Sense+and+Nonsense+of+Alternative+Medicin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac0297dffda9f7b0437037715fe0ab62fb791a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,192,41,125,255,218,159,123,4,55,3,119,21,254,10,182,47,183,145,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
