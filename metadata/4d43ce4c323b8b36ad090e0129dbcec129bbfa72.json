He put a lot of effort into it especially the subtitles. Here is a brief comment by him\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have never created a torrent before, but decided I really had to for this film. It's amazing to realise that Messer im Kopf is as good now as it was on release.\n\nAFAIK, this is the first time it's been available with English subtitles. I made a high quality rip from a full ISO and found some subtitles -- eventually. These I edited to correct errors and fix all the timings. My German is not great so excuse any remaining inaccuracies.\n\nPlease grab and seed since I won't be able to for long. Anyone at all interested in dramas and the wonderful Bruno Ganz will want this film.\n\nEventually we might see an official release with proper subtitles, at which time this torrent will not be required.\n\nThis release includes a high bitrate video and custom-edited English subtitles.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n::Release Info::\n----------------\nRelease Title: Messer Im Kopf\nEncode date: UTC 2012-08-26 23:28:06\n\n::IMDB and TMDB Info::\n----------------------\nTMDB Link: http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/42208\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077924\nStoryline: One night when seeking his estranged wife, Hoffmann goes to the youth center where she works.
