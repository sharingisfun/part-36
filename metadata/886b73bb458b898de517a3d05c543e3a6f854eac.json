The book provides the definition of each disease/disorder followed by clinical features, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, investigations and special points. Every opportunity is taken to illustrate variations in conditions that occur with age or racial group. The second edition now features treatment and management for each disease and disorder and expanded or new sections for over 40 conditions, plus 100 new clinical color photographs. A Colour Handbook of Dermatology will appeal to a wide range of reader, including dermatologists in practice and training; post-registration trainees in acute medicine; general practitioners; specialist nurses; and senior medical students.\n\n\n# Paperback: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Manson Publishing Ltd; 2nd edition (January 15, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1840761105\n# ISBN-13: 978-1840761108","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886b73bb458b898de517a3d05c543e3a6f854eac","amp;dn":"Colour+Handbook+Of+Dermatology+%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886b73bb458b898de517a3d05c543e3a6f854eac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,107,115,187,69,139,137,141,229,23,163,208,92,84,62,58,111,133,78,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
