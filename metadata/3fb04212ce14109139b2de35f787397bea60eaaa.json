Culled from sessions cut in the &amp;#039;50s and &amp;#039;60s, the mix includes two versions each of the Berlin evergreens &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Face the Music and Dance&quot; (Jackie McLean and Sheila Jordan) and &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (Art Tatum and Jutta Hip), as well as such other usual suspects as &quot;How Deep is the Ocean&quot; (Miles Davis), &quot;Say It Isn&amp;#039;t So&quot; (Stan Kenton), and &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; (Lou Donaldson). Some vocals-loving fans of the standards might find the heavy hard bop menu a bit much, but the quality here is still superb throughout. ~ All Music Guide\n\nTrack Listings:\n1.
