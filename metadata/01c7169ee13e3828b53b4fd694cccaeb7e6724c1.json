Lovecraft Historical Society, both A Very Scary Solstice and An Even Scarier Solstice (http://www.cthulhulives.org/Solstice/), classical christmas tunes with new lyrics fitter to the return of the Great Old Ones.\n\nSince I'm completely useless at handling ripping software and don't have a scanner, the torrent only contains the FLAC files (no CUE sheets, no cover scans and no booklet scans, if you want them go buy the CDs).\n\nI'm on a fairly slow DSL connection, so seeding will start out a bit crappy. Hang on.\n\nI'd forgotten rar'd archives of the album in the previous upload, doubling the size of the torrent for essentially no gain to anybody.\n\nSorry about that, won't happen again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c7169ee13e3828b53b4fd694cccaeb7e6724c1","amp;dn":"An+Unbearably+Scary+Solstice+Combo+%28FLAC%29+%28fixed+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c7169ee13e3828b53b4fd694cccaeb7e6724c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,199,22,158,225,62,56,40,181,59,79,214,148,204,202,235,126,103,36,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
