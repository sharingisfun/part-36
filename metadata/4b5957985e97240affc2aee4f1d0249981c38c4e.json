After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.\n\nThe static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users, but because a user's details are displayed in the comment form after they leave a comment those requests are handled by the legacy caching engine. Static files are served to:\n\n*Users who are not logged in.\n*Users who have not left a comment on your blog.\n*Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.\n\n\nINSTALLING:\n1. Download the plugin file to your computer\n2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the plugin \n3. folder to your WordPress installationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wp-content/plugins/ directory.\n4.
