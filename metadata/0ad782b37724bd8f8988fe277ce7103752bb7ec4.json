Here, Lord Mountbatten narrates his life story using a wealth of historical material from the archives of the world - including much from his own personal collection. This extraordinary 12 episode series spans 70 years of triumph, conflict and glory in the life of this remarkable man who rose to worldwide recognition as both statesman and military hero, yet was tragically assassinated in 1979. It is this tremendous sweep of international events and changes that has been recaptured in ths unique series. Unique because it is not only about, but with the man concerned. The production team, including Lord Mountbatten, revisited many of the locales in which his career was formed - Malta, Burma, Ceylon, Singapore, India. Excerpts have been incuded from many of those whose lives and duties infuenced those of Lord Mountbatten, or were influenced by him. They include the Duke of Windsor, Prince Philip, six former Prime Ministers, General Eisenhower and other key figures in world history. \n\nA Television History by John Terraine\nProduced and Directed by Peter Morley\nNarration spoken by Alec Mango\nA Rediffusion Television Production\n\n\n\n\n8)  The Meaning of Victory \nThe years 1945-1946.\n\nWith the end of the Far East war and the resulting chaos, Mountbatten's priority is the liberation of POWs, in which he is greatly helped by Lady Mountbatten. He also makes the unpopular move of using the many remaining Japanese as police. Mountbatten increasingly becomes involved with political problems: in Singapore with anti-British demonstrations and strikes led by the communists; in Siam, where Mountbatten hopes to retain the monarchy; in French Indo-China, where the British initially help to keep order; in the Dutch East Indies, where the British in the middle of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict experience their worst problems. Mountbatten saves Nehru's visit to Singapore from disaster by taking charge personally, and then makes a successful Australia and New Zealand tour with his wife. He hands over governorship to MacDonald in May 1946 and returns to England to receive the Sword of Honour and Freedom of the City of London, to become Earl Mountbatten of Burma and finally a Knight of the Garter.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1987 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:25.592\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 785 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad782b37724bd8f8988fe277ce7103752bb7ec4","amp;dn":"Thames+Television+The+Life+and+Times+of+Lord+Mountbatten+08of12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad782b37724bd8f8988fe277ce7103752bb7ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,215,130,179,119,36,189,143,137,136,254,39,124,231,16,55,82,187,126,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
