It also features former Excel guitarist Adam Siegel, ex-Suicidal Tendencies bassist Robert Trujillo (now in Metallica), and ex-Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins. To date, the project released four albums between 1991 and 2000.\nThough Muir's sense of humor was often obvious with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious\nGrooves often brought out a goofier type of humor: their albums contain comedy skits by\na reptilian lover named Aladdin Sarsippius Sulemenagic Jackson the third.\nThe Infectious Grooves have been on hiatus between the release of their fourth album, 2000's Mas Borracho and 2007, having not written new material, toured or recorded, but the band's personnel have kept busy with other projects. 2008 sees the return of the band on tour with a one-month tour across Europe in April featuring Steve Brunner on bass, Eric Moore on drums, Dean Pleasants and Tim Stewart on guitars. As stated by Muir in 2006 on Suicidal Tendencies' official website, Infectious Grooves had been working on new material\n\n.:Infectious Grooves:.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/9646/infectious.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/9646/infectious.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1991 Punk It Up (CD Single) @320\n1991 The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It's The Infectious Grooves @320\n1992 Feed the Monkey (CD Single) @320\n1993 Sarsippius' Ark (Limited Edition) @320\n1993 The Great Infectious Cover-Up (CD Single) @320\n1994 Groove Family Cyco (Snapped Lika Mutha) @320\n1999 Mas Borracho @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d29ffbf2bc62548bee19ff9be62ef1e8805a97","amp;dn":"Infectious+Grooves+-+Discography+1991-1999+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Vi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9d29ffbf2bc62548bee19ff9be62ef1e8805a97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,210,159,251,242,188,98,84,139,238,25,255,155,230,46,241,232,128,90,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
