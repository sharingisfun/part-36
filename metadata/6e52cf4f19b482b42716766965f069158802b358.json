The infected transform \ninto vampire like creatures that must sleep during the day and roam the earth \nat night. One lone human survivor, Robert Neville, must live a life of stark \nloneliness during the day, and absolute peril at night.\n\nAdapted by Steve Niles and Elman Brown and originally published in 1991 by \nEclipse Comics, it was later collected into a trade paperback by IDW Publishing.\n\n*** This is NOT based on the Will Smith Movie. This is an adapatation of the \noriginal Book by Richard Matheson which is amazing and even though he called\nhis creatures 'vampires' and they had vampiric tendancies and weaknesses, Matheson\nand his book I Am Legend are generally credited with being the first true Zombie\nstory. Note that besides the characters name, The Will Smith movie had almost\nnothing to do with this book it was based on. This is one of my favorite books\nand this comic adapation is excellent. ***\n\nEnjoy and Please SEED ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e52cf4f19b482b42716766965f069158802b358","amp;dn":"Richard+Matheson%5C%27s+-+I+Am+Legend+%5BIDW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e52cf4f19b482b42716766965f069158802b358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,82,207,79,25,180,130,180,39,22,118,105,101,240,105,21,136,2,179,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
