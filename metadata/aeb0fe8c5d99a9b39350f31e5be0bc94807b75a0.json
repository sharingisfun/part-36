Decryption is being done instantly. Decrypted file can be opened in any PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat Reader) without any restrictions -- i.e. with edit/copy/print functions enabled. All versions of Adobe Acrobat (including 9.x, which features 128-bit encryption) are supported.\n\n    The standard security provided by PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords, 'user password' and 'owner password'. A PDF document may be protected by password for opening ('user' password) and the document may also specify operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted: printing; copying text and graphics out of the document; modifying the document; and adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields (using 'owner' password). \n\nEnjoy and keep seeding.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb0fe8c5d99a9b39350f31e5be0bc94807b75a0","amp;dn":"PDF.Password.Remover.3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb0fe8c5d99a9b39350f31e5be0bc94807b75a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,176,254,140,93,153,169,179,147,80,243,30,91,224,188,148,128,123,117,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
