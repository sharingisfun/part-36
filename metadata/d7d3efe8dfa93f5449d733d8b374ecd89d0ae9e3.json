The story was already made famous on the stage by star Helen Hayes. At almost 40 years old and lacking her signature curls, Pickford plays the young Southern belle Norma Besant, who is courting three different men: Stanley (Matt Moore), Robert (George S. Irving), and bad boy Michael Jeffrey (Johnny Mack Brown). She naturally falls for Michael and flees with him to a cottage. Her angry father, Dr. John Besant (John M. St. Polis), follows them with his shotgun, shooting both Michael and himself. Superstar Pickford won Best Actress at the 1930 Academy awards. \n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019788/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019788/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coquette_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coquette_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAwards:Won Oscar\n\n\nDirector:Sam Taylor\n\n\n\n Mary Pickford ...
