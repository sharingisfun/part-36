To fulfill their commission from a Swiss cultural festival, they adapted a great Swiss novel, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Pache, Painter from the Vaud,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Charles Ferdinand Ramuz, from 1911 (about a local artist who goes to Paris for his education and then returns home) and extruded its autobiographical analogies to GodardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own life and work.

Art is endowed with the immediate personal intensity of lived experience, and a lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memory emerges, with exemplary pathos, as a wondrous fiction. This compact crystallization of fable and reality is as ample as a full-length feature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b9d285c77bffc39eaba757449eff5b5ba463e0","amp;dn":"Liberte.et.Patrie.Godard.2002.DVDRip.XviD.subs.eng.esp.pt-br","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b9d285c77bffc39eaba757449eff5b5ba463e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,185,210,133,199,123,255,195,158,171,167,87,68,158,255,91,91,164,99,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
