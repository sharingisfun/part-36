They enjoyed a second wave revival spell of success and interest in their music from the late seventies until disbandment in 1990. Their unique guitar sound was originally produced by a combination of American Fender guitars, British amplifiers made by Vox and echo units Meazzi Echomatic tape and Binson magnetic disc\nWith singer Cliff Richard, The Shadows dominated the British popular music scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s (i.e. the five-year &quot;Before-Beatles&quot; period: 1958-1962), before The Beatles' first full year in the charts in 1963.\nJohn Lennon once claimed that &quot;before Cliff and The Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music.&quot; As the first backing band to emerge as stars in their own right, they were early trailblazers for the beat-group boom that eclipsed them. - The Times. 30 November 2005\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcfa5374620756b862b3b8c9020bf6e9a097e0e","amp;dn":"The+Shadows-1959-1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcfa5374620756b862b3b8c9020bf6e9a097e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,207,165,55,70,32,117,107,134,43,59,140,144,32,191,110,154,9,126,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
