New Groove (Columbia CS-8785) presents him fronting his own quartet accompanied by trombone, and a piano-less rhythm section of bass and drums. \n\nThe second LP, The College Concert of Pee Wee Russell and Henry Red Allen (Impulse AS-9137), appears here for the first time ever on CD. It features the clarinettist in a quintet format co-led by Allen, backed by an impressive modern rhythm section composed of Steve Kuhn on piano, Charlie Haden on bass, and Marty Morell on drums. As a bonus, Ã¢â‚¬Å“MarioochÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which marks the only quartet song featuring Russell from the larger group album Jazz Reunion.\n\nNew Groove is one of two albums that Russell made in quartets organized by Marshall Brown. Brown, on valve trombone and bass trumpet, bassist Russell George and drummer Ron Lundberg join Russell in a set list that is quite wide ranging. The nine songs range from Count Basie (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Taps MillerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moten SwingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and bop (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good BaitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Round MidnightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to John ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red PlanetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pee WeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blues.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Throughout the set, Russell plays in his own unique style, sounding both hesitant and confident at the same time.\n\nThe College Concert from 1967 teams Russell with trumpeter Henry Ã¢â‚¬Å“RedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Allen for the first time on records since 1932. Joined by a young andmodern rhythm section (pianist Steve Kuhn, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Marty Morell), the two veteran horn players perform a relaxed set comprised of a variety of blues, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want A Little GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an excellent Allen feature on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Body And Soul.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is the first time that this music has been made available on CD.\nThis generous disc brings back rare and enjoyable music from the at Pee Wee Russell that is well worth hearing.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Groove\n01.
