In those cases a digital copy is much more easily obtained and also more easily hidden from prying eyes.\n\nThis is version &quot;2.0&quot; and we&amp;#039;ve improved the text and layout of the main body of the work, corrected typos, added Acrobat bookmarks and added a lot more extra material (listed below).\n\nWe did not do the initial book scan, but we spell-checked and corrected the scan, added the original rare &quot;extended dedications&quot; from the first edition (they are practically a bibliography), compiled all four known introductions from various editions (something the publishers/introduction writers never would or could do), used front and rear cover scans from an Avon first edition, added collected appendices on various topics and taken first steps toward an Anton Szandor LaVey reading list. There is also a small photo gallery.\n\nPlease direct any mistakes, extra material, infernal diatribes or love notes to the address in the Colophon.\n\nUnderground Edition 2 Appendices:\n\nI.
