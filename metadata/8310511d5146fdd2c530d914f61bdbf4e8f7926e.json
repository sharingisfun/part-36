Seven hundred and fifty photographs unravel the mysteries of the method and provide practical application on the spot.\r\nEach technique is further explained in terms of how it makes the food taste: What happens, for example, if you cook the fish in butter versus oil? Why does roasting make vegetables taste so good? How do you decide whether you want to make a chicken stew or sautT?\r\n\r\nHere are answers to just about every cooking question, from the simple to the sublime: how to boil an artichoke or cook a soft-boiled egg, or how to clean soft-shell crabs or even butcher and roast a whole saddle of lamb. Knowing how to execute a technique makes you efficient; knowing why you've chosen that technique makes you a master","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8310511d5146fdd2c530d914f61bdbf4e8f7926e","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Cooking+%281999%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8310511d5146fdd2c530d914f61bdbf4e8f7926e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,16,81,29,81,70,253,210,197,48,217,20,246,27,219,244,232,247,146,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
