I have a scary outfitÃ¢â‚¬â€IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going as the Affordable Care Act, because that seems to be the thing that frightens Republicans the most. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just go dressed up in one of those costumes where you have a fake axe in your head, except that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be getting affordable health care for the injury. The only problem is that if I trick or treat at a Republican house theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to repeal my costume... or at least try to delay it until after Halloween.\n\nA woman in North Dakota says she is going to hand out letters about childhood obesity instead of candy to any trick-or-treaters that she deems to be overweight. How does this woman intend to discern which children are too chubby when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all in costumes? Everybody knows that a vampire cape adds 10 pounds to anybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appearance. If you really want to help children not to consume too many sweets, just hand out candy corn. Nobody can eat that crap.\n\nMichele Bachmann says that the healthcare system we had before was Ã¢â‚¬Å“fabulous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fabulous? Michele has spent so many years with Marcus that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s starting to speak gay! Really, Michele, the only people who use the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“fabulousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are gay men and Cher. Michele, drop the Ã¢â‚¬Å“fabulousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and try something like Ã¢â‚¬Å“excellent.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on CNN, not Bravo! ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wolf Blitzer youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking to, not Andy Cohen.\n\nMeanwhile, John Stossel from Fox News says that insurance companies should be free to discriminate against women. John, if women want to be treated unfairly, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll join the military. Stossel says women should be charged more because Ã¢â‚¬Å“Women go to the doctor much more often than men.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Um John, I believe that going to a doctor is something that a lot of health experts actually recommend. Who costs more to take care ofÃ¢â‚¬â€a woman who gets regular checkups, or some guy who has no use for a doctor until they have a debilitating stroke?\n\nI donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think that John Stossel grasps the concept of Ã¢â‚¬Å“insurance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stossel said Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair if you pay for what you use, unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re destitute.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John, there is a term for the type of health insurance system where people pay for the amount of healthcare that they useÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called Ã¢â‚¬Å“no health insurance system.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70a0159f1a69f9372b7ee002db1cbb1f92ed317f","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+31+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70a0159f1a69f9372b7ee002db1cbb1f92ed317f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,160,21,159,26,105,249,55,43,126,224,2,219,28,187,31,146,237,49,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
