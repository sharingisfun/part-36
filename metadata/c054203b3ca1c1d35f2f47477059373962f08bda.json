ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the case made by The Lowest Pair on their new album. 36Ã‚Â¢ is the debut from the folksy duo of Kendl Winter and Palmer T. Lee. They made 36Ã‚Â¢ sitting across from each other in a room, without tracking instruments and vocals separately. It was recorded and engineered by Dave Simonett, a fellow bluegrass player and member of Trampled By Turtles. The result is an intimacy thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s startlingly. 36Ã‚Â¢ tackles harmonies and minimalist strings with flair and wit.\n\nWith their cotton flannel and baseball hats, Winter and Lee look like hippie organic farmers. Come to find out, they both have a penchant for growing things, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multiple gardens in Minneapolis or the sprouts that Winter grows in the back of the tour bus. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no surprise then that their album lauds the pastoral life with songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pear Tree,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which compares love and sex to the life of a pear tree, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trying To Feel At Home,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which laments the drudgery of city life and its constrictions on harvesting raspberries and Orange Kush.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naturalistic themes go hand-in-hand with big existential topics about death and oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purpose in life. Lyrics about growing old arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always taken so seriously though, such as on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dock My BoatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which Winter names all the things sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s planning to see in death: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thirteen turtles, four cats, three guinea pigs, and a bird. Oh and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my best friend, Sam.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sometimes it sounds like Orange Kush was being passed in those writing sessions as they came up with this secular interpretation of Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the Sweet By-and-By.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c054203b3ca1c1d35f2f47477059373962f08bda","amp;dn":"The+Lowest+Pair+-+36%26cent%3B+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c054203b3ca1c1d35f2f47477059373962f08bda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,84,32,59,60,161,193,211,95,47,71,71,112,89,55,57,98,240,139,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
