Could this mean the unravelling of the causal nexus and the end of the universe itself?\n\nThe Doctor must pit his wits against the Master in a desperate battle to thwart his plans. But he is aware that this might be a fight which could easily spell the end of his life.\n\nLike before, if anyone wants to help out, I'd like to see the uncompressed files for The Time Monster uploaded. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7e83c96721082f239547270dcfd83d1beb7e3ce","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Logopolis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7e83c96721082f239547270dcfd83d1beb7e3ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,232,60,150,114,16,130,242,57,84,114,112,220,253,131,209,190,183,227,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
