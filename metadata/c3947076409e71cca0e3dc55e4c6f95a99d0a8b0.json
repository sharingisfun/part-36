However, Koster does not provide enough documentary evidence to prove this, and none of the many other important factors and actors involved in America's stance after Pearl Harbor is elaborated here. While it would be appropriate to discuss the activities and influence of communist agents in Washington at the time, Koster spends most of his book rehashing the well-known military and diplomatic history leading up to Pearl Harbor, contrary to the implication that White's story will be central to his argument. VERDICT Conspiracy theorists and those interested in any discussion of Soviet infiltration of the U.S. government may wish to consider.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3947076409e71cca0e3dc55e4c6f95a99d0a8b0","amp;dn":"John+Koster+-+Operation+Snow+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3947076409e71cca0e3dc55e4c6f95a99d0a8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,148,112,118,64,158,113,204,160,227,220,85,228,198,249,90,153,208,168,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
