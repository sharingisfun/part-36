The show\\'s tag-line is \\&quot;exploring the history of ideas\\&quot; and subject matter jumps eclectically from science to history, literature, religion and philosophy. The experts are almost always erudite and able to explain the sometimes-complex material so as to be understandable to the reasonably educated layman.\n\nThis torrent includes all 45 episodes of In Our Time that were broadcast in 2010.\n\n\n2010-01-04 The Royal Society and British Science: Episode 1\n2010-01-05 The Royal Society and British Science: Episode 2\n2010-01-06 The Royal Society and British Science: Episode 3\n2010-01-07 The Royal Society and British Science: Episode 4\n2010-01-14 The Frankfurt School\n2010-01-21 The Glencoe Massacre\n2010-01-28 Silas Marner\n2010-02-04 Ibn Khaldun\n2010-02-11 Mathematics\\' Unintended Consequences\n2010-02-18 The Indian Mutiny\n2010-02-25 Calvinism\n2010-03-04 The Infant Brain\n2010-03-11 Boudica\n2010-03-18 Munch and The Scream\n2010-03-25 The City - a history, part 1\n2010-04-01 The City - a history, part 2\n2010-04-08 William Hazlitt\n2010-04-15 The Zulu Nation\\'s Rise and Fall\n2010-04-22 Roman Satire\n2010-04-29 The Great Wall of China\n2010-05-06 The Cool Universe\n2010-05-13 William James\\'s \\'The Varieties of Religious Experience\\'\n2010-05-20 The Cavendish Family in Science\n2010-05-27 Giorgio Vasari\\'s Lives of the Artists\n2010-06-03 Edmund Burke\n2010-06-10 al-Biruni\n2010-06-17 The Neanderthals\n2010-06-24 Antarctica\n2010-07-01 Athelstan\n2010-07-08 Pliny\\'s Natural History\n2010-09-23 Imaginary Numbers\n2010-09-30 The Delphic Oracle\n2010-10-07 The Spanish Armada\n2010-10-14 Sturm und Drang\n2010-10-21 Logic\n2010-10-28 The Unicorn\n2010-11-04 Women and Enlightenment Science\n2010-11-11 The Volga Vikings\n2010-11-18 Foxe\\'s Book of Martyrs\n2010-11-25 History of Metaphor\n2010-12-02 Cleopatra\n2010-12-09 Edison\n2010-12-16 Daoism\n2010-12-23 The Industrial Revolution\n2010-12-30 Consequences of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d98083fad29b5af992525498fbf57247e2928d7d","amp;dn":"In+Our+Time++%28BBC+-+2010+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d98083fad29b5af992525498fbf57247e2928d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,128,131,250,210,155,90,249,146,82,84,152,251,245,114,71,226,146,141,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
