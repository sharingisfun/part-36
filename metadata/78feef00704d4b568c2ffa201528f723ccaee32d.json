Royksopp, Dakah Hip-Hop Orchestra, Felix Da Housecat and N*E*R*D just to name a few.\n\nAll songs are in mp3 format with a 128 bit rate. Don't like it? Don't download it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78feef00704d4b568c2ffa201528f723ccaee32d","amp;dn":"SCION+Samplers+Vol.+1-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78feef00704d4b568c2ffa201528f723ccaee32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,254,239,0,112,77,75,86,140,47,250,32,21,40,247,35,204,174,227,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
