Keith Olsen was suggested because of the success of his work on Whitesnake&amp;#039;s 1987. Tony Clarkin, the band&amp;#039;s guitarist and usually the sole songwriter, then invited co-writers such as Russ Ballard, Jim Vallance and David Cassidy&amp;#039;s wife Sue Shiffrin to collaborate on songwriting duties. Other songs called &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;On That Day&quot; were retitled or dropped. &quot;Come Back Running&quot; was recorded as a demo version, but it was never released.\n\nThe rest of the band flew to Los Angeles in 1990 to record at Keith Olsen&amp;#039;s studios, &quot;Goodnight L.A.&quot; The album was originally titled Born To Be King but was eventually named after the studio.\n\nThree singles were planned, &quot;RockinÃƒÂ¢?? Chair&quot; being the lead single, then &quot;Heartbroke And Busted&quot;; the third single, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, was cancelled because Polydor was disappointed with the chart ranking of &quot;Heartbroke And Busted&quot;.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTony Clarkin ÃƒÂ¢??
