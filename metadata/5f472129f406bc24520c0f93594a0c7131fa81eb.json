ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all set above the Lac de Serre-PonÃƒÂ§on which is a popular windsurfing spot in the Alps meaning if the breeze is up this could be even harder for the riders.\n\n(profile pic and description from inrng.com/tour/#Stage17)\n\n\nSD broadcast, encapsulated 16:9, 576i, 25fps at ~2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -vf &quot;yadif=0:-1:0&quot; -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f472129f406bc24520c0f93594a0c7131fa81eb","amp;dn":"Tour+de+France+2013+stage+17+-+Embrun+to+Chorges+32km+ITT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f472129f406bc24520c0f93594a0c7131fa81eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,71,33,41,244,6,188,36,82,12,15,147,89,74,12,113,49,250,129,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
