The architects were not selected to represent a preconceived point of view, but because their buildings, their statements and their concerns seem generally to represent the most positive and influential directions in American architecture today. Their approaches are diverse, ranging from the more rational, structural, to the more plastic, sculptural, while certain consistencies also indicate parallel ideas in general directions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5338bd18be7231d045bb2876ba0d6b4449c03c2","amp;dn":"Architects+on+architecture%3B+new+directions+in+America+%28Art+Book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5338bd18be7231d045bb2876ba0d6b4449c03c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,51,139,209,139,231,35,29,4,91,178,135,107,160,214,180,68,156,3,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
