From time to time\n we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is\n a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,\n then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,\n not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies\n we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that\n a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying. Stay drunk and stay disco!\n\n SHOUTOUTS \n\n  NOS - GrimRippers - TWiST - SiCK - WSR - BLooDWeiSeR - RWH - PFTP - BRUTUS\n      \n\t     ...and to all of those contributing to the scene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:516f765cf62b977071cffcaba7cca9adbd4307e4","amp;dn":"Marathon.Man.1976.AC3.DVDRiP.XViD-aGGr0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"516f765cf62b977071cffcaba7cca9adbd4307e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,111,118,92,246,43,151,112,113,207,252,171,167,204,169,173,189,67,7,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
