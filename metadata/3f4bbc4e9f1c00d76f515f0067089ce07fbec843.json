The dragon in question is really the enchanted form of a woman (Katherine Isabelle) from another dimension, and in her scaly form, she killed the father of young Robin Hood. Flash forward a couple of decades, and the grown Robin (Robin Dunne) suffers a serious hitch in his take-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor arrangement, courtesy of the evil Prince John (David Richmond-Peck) and the even more wicked Sheriff of Nottingham (Julian Sands, who consumes the scenery with relish), both of whom use the lady/dragon against him and his Merry Men. It's a novel idea, but executed with dreary pacing by actor-turned-director Peter DeLuise, rickety special effects, and dreadful acting by all save Sands and Erica Durance (Smallville's Lois Lane) as an action-ready Maid Marian.\n\nVideo\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 33mn\nBit rate : 936 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.176\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 33mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 104 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\ncredit X BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f4bbc4e9f1c00d76f515f0067089ce07fbec843","amp;dn":"Beyond+Sherwood+Forest%282009%29DVDRip%5BXvid%5D%7B1337x%7D-X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f4bbc4e9f1c00d76f515f0067089ce07fbec843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,75,188,78,159,28,0,215,111,81,95,0,103,8,156,224,127,190,200,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
