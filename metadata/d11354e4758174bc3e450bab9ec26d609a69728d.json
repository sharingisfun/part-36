Its a four Volume version, its a Scan.\n\nThe only problem is that its not indexed in anyway, I have it in 4 files ; containing each of the four volumes. \n\nThe scan is done well. its just not indexed. i would do that, if i knew how.\n\nAnd unless you have a fast computer, higher then intel pentim 4, then then you would have to wait a long time for the PDF to generate the images for each page. theres a lot of pages, that's way.\n\n\nBut this is good, if you can get it indexed.  The Smiths bible Dictionary is the best,. and this rare 4 volume makes it even better.  \n\nneeds indexing.
