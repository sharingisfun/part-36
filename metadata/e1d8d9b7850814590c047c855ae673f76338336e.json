During the 1940s and 1950s there were various combinations of all \neight brothers and sisters, always including Howard. Sam served in the Air \nForce while Bobby worked as a truck driver and played some rock and roll \nbands. Rusty served in the armed forces as well as singing with The \nPlainsmen Quartet afterwards. Howard's wife Vestal joined the group as well. \nAfter all the sisters married, Howard and Vestal became evangelists. Soon \nSam joined again followed by Rusty in 1962 and Bobby on bass guitar not \nlong afterwards.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1d8d9b7850814590c047c855ae673f76338336e","amp;dn":"Happy+Goodman+Family+-+This+Happy+House+%281969%29+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1d8d9b7850814590c047c855ae673f76338336e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,216,217,183,133,8,20,89,12,4,124,133,90,230,115,247,99,56,51,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
