All hope seems lost for the once regal amphibian. But suddenly, out of nowhere, a strange bottle floats down the stream and catches his attention. Intrigued, our soon-to-be-hero takes a huge swig and after a few minor explosions he becomes the legend that is soon to be known as Superfrog! With boundless courage and new heights of determination, he sets off towards the Magic Forest with three objectives in mind. One, to get back his girl, two, to vanquish the curse, and three, give that nasty old witch just what she deserves! \n\nSuperfrog is a classic 2D platform game with colorful and cheerful graphics and fast-paced action.
