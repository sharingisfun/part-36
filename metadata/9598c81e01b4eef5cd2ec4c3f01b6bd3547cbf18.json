It's the end of the year, and here's your present: The very first book in the new Marvel lineup. The collected torrent for this week's Marvel NOW! is technically the collected torrent for All-New Marvel NOW! is technically not a collection at all. Included are:\n\n\nAvengers 024.NOW\n\n\nIf you like it and have the money, BUY IT and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. All my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nThat's it. Origin II is also out this week, but it's not part of either the Marvel NOW! or All-New lineups. Since All-New Marvel NOW! is considered a successor to Marvel NOW!, I'd like your input: the last actual Marvel NOW! book won't be out until the end of February. In the meantime, books from both Marvel NOW! and All-New (mostly the latter) will be released. Should I use dual numbering for Marvel NOW! and All-New Marvel NOW!, starting with this week's All-New Marvel NOW! Week 001,  or should we just continue using the Marvel NOW! numbering going forward?\n\nHope you all stay safe, stay happy, stay healthy.
