REAL LIFE. REAL FLAVOR.\r\n \r\nForever short on time, Associated Press food editor J. M. Hirsch is a master of kitchen shortcuts; his favorite, letting high-flavor ingredients do the heavy lifting, was the inspiration for this collection of nearly 150 boldly delicious recipes. Because nobody has time to make a bland meal.\r\n\r\nHis approach to cooking is simple: Foods that taste great going into the pot need less work from you to taste great when they come out. He shows busy cooks how to use ingredients with intense flavor to make the meals they want in the time they have.\r\n\r\nThe recipes are easy and the flavors are robust. Try Four-Cheese Baked Gnocchi, Pork Chops with Red Wine Cranberry Sauce, Red Curry Beef, Sweet-and-Savory BBQ Chicken, Chili Balsamic Marinated Sirloin with Fettuccine and Sun-Dried Tomatoes, and Bacon, Beans, and Beer Chili. Thereâ€™s even dessert, with Balsamic Chocolate Cookie Ice Cream and Grilled Cinnamon-Sugar Breadsticks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8d5a7b306eaa6308f01c1beaace7d33bb593b5","amp;dn":"High+Flavor%2C+Low+Labor+%282010%29+%28Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8d5a7b306eaa6308f01c1beaace7d33bb593b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,141,90,123,48,110,170,99,8,240,28,27,234,172,231,211,59,181,147,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
