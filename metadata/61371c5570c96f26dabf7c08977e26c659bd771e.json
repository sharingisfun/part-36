All are digitally re-mastered, with rare and previously unreleased bonus material supplementing each release.\n\n\nPendulum (40th Anniversary Edition)\n\nWritten by El Bicho\n\n\nIn honor of the 40th anniversary of their debut album, Fantasy Records is releasing the six studio albums of the band as a quartet. No word yet of their final album, Mardi Gras, which found lead guitarist John Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford as a trio after rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty quit.\n\nThe other album CCR released in 1970 was Pendulum, and it was the final album that featured Tom Fogerty as he quit the band shortly after its release due to inter-band tensions, especially with his brother. The album included two more hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHave You Ever Seen the Rain?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey TonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and is one of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more diverse albums. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPagan BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is borderline hard rock while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSailorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s LamentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with its horns and keyboards is anything but. The band even goes psychedelic in the experimental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRude Awakening #2.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The bonus tracks feature a rare promotional single entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ45 Revolutions Per Minute.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Obviously inspired by the Beatles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevolution 9,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the track has Bay-area disc jockey Tom Campbell interviewing the band while tape loops and guitar licks play in the background. In a further Beatles nod, the sleeve had a message saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA black flag flies at the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Apple headquarters.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Also included is a live version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey TonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the three-man version of the band.\n\n\n\n01 Pagan Baby\n02 Sailor's Lament\n03 Chameleon\n04 Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\n05 (Wish I Could) Hideaway\n06 Born to Move\n07 Hey Tonight\n08 It's Just a Thought\n09 Molina\n10 Rude Awakening #2\n11 45 Revolutions Per Minutes (Part 1) [bonus track]\n12 45 Revolutions Per Minutes (Part 2) [bonus track]\n13 Hey Tonight (Live in Hamburg, 9/17/71) [bonus track]\n\n\n\n\n    * John Fogerty - lead vocals, lead guitar, harmonica, keyboards, saxophone\n    * Tom Fogerty - rhythm guitar, backing vocals, piano\n    * Stu Cook - bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards\n    * Doug Clifford - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61371c5570c96f26dabf7c08977e26c659bd771e","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival-Pendulum%281970%29%282008+Concorde+Rem.%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61371c5570c96f26dabf7c08977e26c659bd771e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,55,28,85,112,201,111,38,218,191,124,8,151,126,38,198,89,189,119,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
