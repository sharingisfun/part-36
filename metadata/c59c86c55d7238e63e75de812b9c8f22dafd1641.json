Once complete, rest assured that I will be back in glorious form with cutting edge up-to-press releases and particular selections covering every shade of distinctly excellent house music.\n\n\nI thank you all for your kind efforts thus far;  the release schedule simply cannot be sustained without your continued appreciation and support.\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59c86c55d7238e63e75de812b9c8f22dafd1641","amp;dn":"John+Dahlback+-+Hustle+Up+%2F+Watch+Me+2007+%5BElectro+House%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59c86c55d7238e63e75de812b9c8f22dafd1641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,156,134,197,93,114,56,230,62,117,222,129,43,156,143,34,218,253,22,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
