It was very hard to track down this full copy. In my opinion this is the best PC version ever made. Nice video clips, music and many game options. You can vs. up to 5 CPU or run multiplayer games over your network.\n\nRelease Date: 1995\nGame Type   : PC Board Game\nDisk        : 1 CD\nSize on HD  : 189MB\n\n\nGameSpot's review:\n\n&quot;I know what you're thinking: &quot;It's Monopoly; how hi-tech can it be?&quot; As unlikely as it may sound, Westwood has transformed Parker Brothers' classic board game into a box full of highly rendered, smoothly animated, multiplayer goodness.\n\nEven in single-player mode, Monopoly shines as a brilliant example of what programmers can do with a simple concept if they set their minds to it. Attached to all game pieces, board locations and events are beautifully rendered 3-D animationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½over 800 in allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that faithfully recreate the game's early 1930s appeal. The soundtrack is pleasant, though it can get annoying over the duration of what are often lengthy competitions. Besides the window dressing, Monopoly also offers everything you'd expect from the board game: money, extensive trading options that allow players to wheel and deal properties, and even &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; cards.\n\nMonopoly's greatest feature is its carefully designed multiplayer support. You can challenge up to five other players in either network or Internet mode. If none of your friends are ready to play, check out Westwood's Internet waiting room, where you'll find other players from all over the world who are looking for a game. (Yes, the game will even sort out differences in language and currency types.).\n\nIn the end, even with all the bells and whistles, Monopoly is Monopoly, and if you don't like the board game, you won't like the computer adaptation. But if you're a fan, Westwood's take on the venerable classic is a great way to compete with players all over the world from the comfort of your own home.&quot;\n\n\nInstall instructions:\n\n1. Extract Westwood Monopoly.iso\n2. Extract Setup_cd.exe from the Monopoly_32_bit_Installer.rar\n3. Mount Westwood Monopoly.iso\n4.
