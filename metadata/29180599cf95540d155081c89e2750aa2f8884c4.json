Long prized by folk collectors, it was neither critically nor commercially successful. Distilling their collective influences Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mainly Dylan, Paul Simon and the ISB Ã¢â‚¬â€œ into an idiosyncratic and lively mix, Tony Hulme and Mick Lawson created a minor folk masterpiece. The addition of hired hands like BJ Cole and Herbie Flowers contribute to a rich, polychromatic record that gets you from the first listen.\n\nThe acoustic whimsy of the opener DodoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &amp; Dinosaurs and others such as Store Of Time and the narcissistic Firefly are exactly what one would expect to hear on a lost folk record from this period. But the majority of the other songs arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. The hypnotic Gypsy, the dust-kickinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Rum Runner and, the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpiece, the anthemic Borderline (about a young British Soldier in World War I) make this album a large, baroque-fashioned cut above.\n\nThe wealth and quality of the bonus material herein, including their odd final single, a cover of Neil YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dance Dance Dance, complete a rich and rewarding Evensong picture.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29180599cf95540d155081c89e2750aa2f8884c4","amp;dn":"Evensong+-+Evensong+%5B1973%5D+%7B2010+Beatball+LP+MINIATURE%7D+%28FLAC.CU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29180599cf95540d155081c89e2750aa2f8884c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,24,5,153,207,149,84,13,21,80,129,200,158,39,80,170,47,136,132,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
