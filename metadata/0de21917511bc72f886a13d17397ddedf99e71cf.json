Inspired by a headline on the website Truthdig (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo Banker Left BehindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), these 14 songs tackle what the legendary guitarist sees as the death of news ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstoriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in favor of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcontentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½shallow, context-less sound bites that fail to capture the complexity of world events, to convey texture or impart a sense of consequence.\nDrawing on his wide range of musical influences (blues, rock, jug bands, norteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o), the man behind Keith RichardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ guitar tuning and The Buena Vista Social Club sings fiercely about war and immigration policy; Wall Street and white flight. True to his albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mission, he narrates from a number of perspectives, many of them rarely heard.&quot;\nTracklist\n\n1. No Banker Left Behind 3:34\n2.
