Soon the friends' passion spreads to other\n political prisoners who join them in a 66 day hunger strike.\n\nThe hunger strike of May 1981 was a revival of the hunger\nprotest of late 1980, when seven strikers abandoned their \nfast, misled into believing that the government was about\nto give in to their demands. Until 1976, IRA political prisoners\nhad virtual &quot;prisoner of war&quot; status. Then a policy of \n&quot;criminalisation&quot; of terrorists came into force. The prisoners\nrefused to wear convict garb and began the &quot;blanket&quot; and the \n&quot;dirty&quot; campaign. McKeown, who was sentenced to life for the\nattempted murder of an RUC officer and &quot;causing explosions&quot;,\nwas 18 when he was arrested. He began his hunger strike at the\nage of 25.\n\n File Name: H3.avi\nFile Size (Bytes): 272,631,466\n\n[Format]\nFormat (Short Name): avi\nFormat (Long Name): AVI format\nDuration: 01:46:21.06\nDuration (Microseconds): 6,381,061,224\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 341,800\nNumber of Streams: 2\n\n[Metadata]\nencoder: Lavf51.12.1\n\n[Stream #0]\nType: Video\nCodec (Short Name): mpeg4\nCodec (Long Name): MPEG-4 part 2\nCodec Tag: 0x30355844\nCodec Tag (String): DX50\nCodec Time Base: 1/25\nTime Base: 1/25\nReal Base Frame Rate: 25/1\nAverage Frame Rate: 0/0\nDuration: 00:00:00.06\nDuration (Microseconds): 159,522\nBit Rate (bits/sec): N/A\nNumber of Frames: 159,522\n\nWidth: 320\nHeight: 240\nPixel Aspect Ratio: 1:1\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 4:3\nPixel Format: yuv420p\nHas B Frames: No\n\n[Stream #1]\nType: Audio\nCodec (Short Name): mp3\nCodec (Long Name): MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3)\nCodec Tag: 0x00000055\nCodec Tag (String): U[0][0][0]\nCodec Time Base: 0/1\nTime Base: 32/1225\nReal Base Frame Rate: 0/0\nAverage Frame Rate: 0/0\nDuration: 00:00:00.06\nDuration (Microseconds): 244,275\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 128,000\nNumber of Frames: 244,275\n\nChannels: 2\nSample Rate (Hz): 44,100\nBit Rate: 16 bits (Integer)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34ffb88f2b73bd6c9095314a4f414c8bc2d44d82","amp;dn":"H3%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34ffb88f2b73bd6c9095314a4f414c8bc2d44d82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,255,184,143,43,115,189,108,144,149,49,74,79,65,76,139,194,212,77,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
