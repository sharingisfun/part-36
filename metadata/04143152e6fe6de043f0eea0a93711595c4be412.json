Other advanced techniques from recent research efforts that extend beyond ILP to exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP) are also compiled in this book. All of these techniques, as well as the foundational principles behind them, are organized and presented within a clear framework that allows for ease of comprehension. This text is intended for an advanced computer architecture course or a course in super scalar processor design. It is written at a level appropriate for senior or first year graduate level students.\n\n\n\n\nPW/Password/ContraseÃƒÂ±a : comoustedyasabe2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04143152e6fe6de043f0eea0a93711595c4be412","amp;dn":"John+Paul+Shen+-+Modern+Processor+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04143152e6fe6de043f0eea0a93711595c4be412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,20,49,82,230,254,109,224,67,240,238,160,169,55,17,89,92,75,228,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
