Mas Que Nada\n2. Tim Dom Dom\n3. Balanca Pema\n4. Vem Morena, Vem\n5. Chve Chuva\n6. E So Sambar\n7. Rosa, Menina Rosa\n8. Quero Esquecer Voce\n9. Uila Ualala\n10. A Tamba\n11. Menina Bonita Nao Chora\n12. Por Causa De Voce\n\n\n\nMarvellous. A dazzling debut album that helped revitalize Brazilian pop at a time when the bossa nova craze had largely played itself out... This record opens with his version of &quot;Mas, Que Nada,&quot; the hit song that made Jorge Ben and internationally known songwriter. Here Ben works with several of the best samba-jazz and pop bandleaders of the bossa era, including Maestro Gaya, Meirelles, and Luiz Carlos Vinha... Combined with Ben's sleek vocals, each arranger spins magic. Some of the best songs on here, such as &quot;Vem, Morena, Vem,&quot; have been neglected over the years, while others such as &quot;Chove Chuva&quot; are perennial favorites. Listening to the album in its entirety is the way to go -- it not only captures a bright new voice coming through at a special moment in time, it also just sounds great as a cohesive piece of work.\n\n(Review from slipcue.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9771209bfc30daddc0aea5b9c7e4f614004ff48","amp;dn":"Jorge+Ben+-+Samba+Esquema+Novo%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9771209bfc30daddc0aea5b9c7e4f614004ff48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,119,18,9,191,195,13,173,220,10,234,91,156,126,79,97,64,4,255,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
