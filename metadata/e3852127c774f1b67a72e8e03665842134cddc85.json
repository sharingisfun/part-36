It appeared on his album Blood on the Tracks in 1975. Rolling Stone ranked it #68 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n&quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; is one of the clearest examples of Dylan's attempts to write &quot;multi-dimensional&quot; songs which defied a fixed notion of time and space. Dylan was influenced by his recent study of painting and the Cubist school of artists, who sought to incorporate multiple perspectives within a single plane of view. As Neil McCormick remarked in 2003: &quot;A truly extraordinary epic of the personal, an unreliable narrative carved out of shifting memories like a five-and-a-half-minute musical Proust.&quot; In a 1978 interview Dylan explained this style of songwriting: &quot;What's different about it is that there's a code in the lyrics, and there's also no sense of time. There's no respect for it. You've got yesterday, today and tomorrow all in the same room, and there's very little you can't imagine not happening&quot;{Interview with Jonathan Cott, Rolling Stone 11/16/78}.\n\nThe lyrics are at times opaque, but the song seems to be (like most of the songs on the album), the tale of a love that has, for the time being, ended, although not by choice; the last verse begins:\n\n    So now I'm goin' back again,\n    I got to get to her somehow...\n\nand ends\n\n    We always did feel the same,\n    We just saw it from a different point of view,\n    Tangled up in blue.\n\nDylan continually re-worked the lyrics even after the album was released; the version on his live album Real Live (and throughout the '84 Europe tour) has radically different lyrics. In the first studio version (NYC sessions, December '74) and often in live performances he has sung some of the verses from a third-person perspective (usually &quot;he was laying in bed,&quot; but sometimes even &quot;she was laying in bed&quot;), as opposed to the first-person point of view in the Blood on the Tracks version.\n\nRon Rosenbaum wrote in Slate that Dylan had told him he wrote the song after spending a weekend immersed in Joni Mitchell's Blue.\n\nBlood on the Tracks is Bob Dylan's 15th studio album, released by Columbia Records in January 1975. The album marked Dylan's return to Columbia after a two-album stint with Asylum Records.\n\nThe album, which followed years of lukewarm reception for Dylan's work, was greeted enthusiastically by fans and critics. In the years following its release it has come to be regarded as one of his best albums; it is quite common for subsequent records to be labeled his &quot;best since Blood on the Tracks.&quot; It is also commonly seen as a standard for confessional singer-songwriter albums; though Dylan has denied that the songs are autobiographical, his son Jakob Dylan has stated: &quot;The songs are my parents talking.&quot; Most of the lyrics on the album revolve around heartache, anger, and loneliness. In 2003, the album was ranked number 16 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album reached #1 on the Billboard U.S. pop charts and #4 in the UK. The single &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; peaked at #31 on the pop singles chart. The album remains one of Dylan's all-time best-selling studio releases, with a double-platinum US certification to date.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3852127c774f1b67a72e8e03665842134cddc85","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Tangled+Up+In+Blue++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3852127c774f1b67a72e8e03665842134cddc85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,133,33,39,199,116,241,182,122,114,232,224,54,101,132,33,52,205,220,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
