Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mary Spongberg- Head of Department of Modern History, Macquarie University, USA\n\nThis book examines sexuality in the past, and explores how it helps explain sexuality in the present. The subject of sexuality is often a controversial one, and exploring it through a world history perspective emphasises the extent to which societies, including our own, are still reacting to historical change through contemporary sexual behaviours, values, and debates.\n\nThe study uses a clear chronological structure to focus on major patterns and changes in sexuality Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both sexual culture and sexual behaviours Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in the main periods of world history, with comparison and discussion across cultures and societies. Topics covered include:\n\nissues involved in studying the history of sexuality\nthe sexual implications of the transition from hunting and gathering economies to agricultural economies\nsexuality in Classical societies\nthe post-Classical period and the spread of the world religions\nsex in an age of trade and colonies\nchanges in sexual behaviours and sexual attitudes between 1750 and 1950\nsex in contemporary world history.\nThe book is a vital contribution to the study of world history, and is the perfect companion for all students of the history of sexuality.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rahvaraamat.ee/images/products/000/234/410/thumbnails/view/92f8950e8c1ea3968982422a6882c4a0df45370b/sexuality-in-world-history.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rahvaraamat.ee/images/products/000/234/410/thumbnails/view/92f8950e8c1ea3968982422a6882c4a0df45370b/sexuality-in-world-history.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nPeter N.
