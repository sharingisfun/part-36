Its unique cell-based design lets you easily mix text and code within one note, edit code with an awesome code editor, and find any note instantly via the full-text search.\r\n\r\nMix Text With Code\r\nA note in Quiver is comprised of cells â€” snippets of text or code. You can freely mix text cells with code cells, even setting different language modes for different code cells, all inside one note.\r\n\r\nEdit In Place\r\nWhether you are writing code or changing text styles, edits are always made in-place. There is no mode switching in Quiver. You just click where you want to edit and start typing.\r\n\r\nAn Awesome Code Editor\r\nThe programmerâ€™s notebook should make code editing effortless. Quiver packs the awesome ACE code editor in code cells, which supports syntax highlighting for most languages, over 20 themes, automatic indent and outdent, and much more.\r\n\r\nLightning-Fast Full-Text Search\r\nNotes are only useful if you can find them quickly. Quiverâ€™s full-text search is based on Search Kit, the same technology used to power Spotlight on your mac. Thatâ€™s how Quiver can search through thousands of notes in a blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nTags\r\nIf organizing notes into notebooks isnâ€™t enough for you, Quiver also lets you assign tags to each note, so you can manage your notes any way you like.\r\n\r\nAutosave\r\nQuiver automatically saves all your changes as you work, so you never need to worry about losing changes.\r\n\r\nPlain JSON\r\nQuiver saves your notes in the plain JSON format, so you have full control over your content. You can export a note in the JSON or HTML format, or print it to PDF.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s new in version 3.0.1:\r\nFixed a bug that caused the app to open with no notes\r\nImplemented swipe gesture support for the main window\r\nAdded support for a custom URL scheme: quiver:///notes/{noteId}\r\nâ€œCopy Note Linkâ€ now copies both internal and external note links\r\nCopy a note as Markdown\r\nCopy a note as HTML source\r\nCopy a note as Code Only\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dccd3b4e750f500a26799eed4f5c1cb64e0d2293","amp;dn":"Quiver+3.0.1+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dccd3b4e750f500a26799eed4f5c1cb64e0d2293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,205,59,78,117,15,80,10,38,121,158,237,79,92,28,182,78,13,34,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
