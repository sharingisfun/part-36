It becomes, at first, a research station, then a colony, and then a prison. Control from Earth ebbs during another economic cycle, and the pirates who used to raid the colony get their due. Independence is not something Earth can tolerate, but how do you control a distant planet? Bombs don't work as well when they take so long to arrive that people can move entire cities out of the way.\n\nVisiting military forces have to refuel if they want to get back to Earth, and this makes diplomacy difficult when you've just been blasting the hell out of their industry. The end result is a well-armed and very angry independent planet with better resources and fewer, but smarter, people than Earth.\n\nLater, their King becomes too old and abdicates in favor of his 15 year old daughter, confident that she can handle anything. This is the story of her reign.\n\nPublished by  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.novelworlds.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.novelworlds.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAvailable on Amazon.com for sale.\n\nDonations accepted by mail, see website for details.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4a69aaa20e0d29efe2b76b4432eae1291bdd51","amp;dn":"Captain+Blood+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4a69aaa20e0d29efe2b76b4432eae1291bdd51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,74,105,170,162,14,13,41,239,226,183,107,68,50,234,225,41,27,221,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
