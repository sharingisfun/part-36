The series launched following a try-out in DC's Showcase #9, and the early plots mostly revolved around Lois Lane's romantic pursuit of Superman and her numerous attempts to marry him, only to fail every time. Later issues had Lois Lane explore more topical concerns, and included more back-up strips.
