Callers weigh in.\n\n\n\nPrager 20120925 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2 Making Sense of Ahmadinejad\n\nPrager H2: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very hard to do. Yesterday he denied IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history in the Middle East. Does he believe\n his own lies?Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ France bans the use of the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“motherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“fatherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from official documents.\n Now that they have same sex marriage, the government consider the words politically incorrectÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n Dennis talks to Michael Leven, President of The Las Vegas Sands Corp. Business leaders are reluctant\n to speak out against the government. If they do, they risk investigations, sanctions and other forms of\n intimidation. This trend has grown much worse during the last three years.\n\n\n\nPrager 20120925 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1 Transforming America\n\nPrager H1: The President famously promised to transform America five days before the last election. \n If he wins a second term, he may succeed. Romney and Ryan should hammer that theme. \n We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want America transformed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Download, seed, and spread the word. \n\n\nMore Stuff is here\nRush, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager\nthepiratebay . se / user / CAPTAIN7SS/0/3\nbeta . demonoid . me / files / ?seeded=2&amp;uid=7492662\n\nRush Shows and Neal Boortz Shows Live are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / amuck5 /\n\nLaura Ingraham podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / freedomczar /\n\nGlenn Beck Insider podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / search / glenn%20beck/0/99/100\n\nPodcasts of the Rush Limbaugh Show are here (temporarily stopped uploading)\nthepiratebay . se / user / Annoyme /\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ab1d23a1fdf9d1c1b4b9f8e97d13120cc06db4","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+SEP-25-2012+TUES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ab1d23a1fdf9d1c1b4b9f8e97d13120cc06db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,171,29,35,161,253,249,209,193,180,185,248,233,125,19,18,12,192,109,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
