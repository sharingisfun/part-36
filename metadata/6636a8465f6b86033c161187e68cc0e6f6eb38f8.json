Nick and Maggie are assigned to escort the repo agent, Mr. Miller, to the farm but arrive to discover it's been stolen prompting a lot of finger pointing. Later that day, Maggie tries to have a word to Bob's daughter, while Miller and his mates return to the farm and rough up Crowley. Turns out that Grace and her boyfriend had &quot;hidden&quot; the harvester so that her father could collect the insurance so he wouldn't lose the farm. Needless-to-say, Miller insists she be charged.\nOn the personal front, Roz is trying to establish a beauty parlour at the watch-keepers house.
