He has four opponents: a wife who wants him to quit, aging, the other boxer, and gangsters out to rig the match. Some nice locker-room dialog and street photography. Also some well-choreographed fighting for the time, although there are certainly more recent examples that are better.\n\n\nAdditional fight-noirs, both with a love-triangle twist, are Ringside and Bad Blonde. I'll try to upload them later.\n\n\n****************\n\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fccd89981e2eba24a083b8029e4d70b8c2e0ebda","amp;dn":"The+Setup+%281949+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fccd89981e2eba24a083b8029e4d70b8c2e0ebda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,205,137,152,30,46,186,36,160,131,184,2,158,77,112,184,194,224,235,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
