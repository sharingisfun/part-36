Explanations of these phenomena, riveting and ultimately rational, encourage further reflection on what shapes our beliefs today.\n\nWhat made reasonable, educated men and women behave in ways that seem utterly nonsensical to us today? This question and many more are answered in this fascinating book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2050c0b81a2e9af097e5a30a0d2220ad6281596d","amp;dn":"Strange+Histories+-+The+Trial+of+the+Pig%2C+the+Walking+Dead%2C+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2050c0b81a2e9af097e5a30a0d2220ad6281596d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,80,192,184,26,46,154,240,151,229,163,10,13,34,32,173,98,129,89,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
