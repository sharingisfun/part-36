Lest he appear weak, he must keep his therapy a secret from the rest of the Mob. He&amp;#039;s stressed: his teenage daughter is giving his wife fits; his mean-spirited mother refuses to move to a retirement community; his aging Uncle Junior, jealous of Tony&amp;#039;s rise to the top, won&amp;#039;t stay in line and engineers a plot to kill Tony; and the feds, armed with RICO, are circling. In therapy, Tony must come to terms with his father&amp;#039;s example, his mother&amp;#039;s manipulations, and his own fears of death and loss of family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08675a69834fac269d05d198c2e2c461cc99db5","amp;dn":"The+Sopranos+Season+1++DVDrip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b08675a69834fac269d05d198c2e2c461cc99db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,134,117,166,152,52,250,194,105,208,93,25,140,46,44,70,28,201,157,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
