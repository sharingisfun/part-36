And no, you can never\nhave quite enough bands or albums like this one. In\nfact, this should be the general standard for rock\nbands. It just seems so obvious that this is what\nyou want from a rock band - not a note wasted.\n\nI?ll undoubtedly listen to ?Angles? hundreds of\ntimes, because it?s already had such a positive\neffect on my life. I?ve felt lethargic all weekend\nup until this point ? I?ve wasted so much time! If\nonly I had put this on at the beginning of the\nweekend, if only this was my alarm clock, I?d wake\nup and feel energized and I?d go about doing good\ndeeds, I?d run for mayor, I?d kiss babies, elders\nand children alike would have meetings to discuss\nwhat a positive influence my boundless energy has\nbeen on the community. I would go to parties in the\nevening and people would ask me what I?d been\nlistening to recently (in that way only true\npopulists do) and I would say ?yeah, yeah, I?m\nreally in to the Hot Gossip album at the moment?,\nand they would say ?oh, I don?t know them? and I say\n?oh they?re brilliant you should check them out?. My\nlife would be like that.\n\nI haven?t listened to this enough times to decide\nwhether it transcends this area of popular party\ntalk. I think it?s hard for such an instantly\ngratifying album to do this, but I have a suspicion\nthat these guys might be able to pull it off. I\ntruly hope so. I want to be able to hand this to my\nfriends and feel like I?m doing them good, doing the\nband good and doing myself good because I can\nsubsequently talk to my friends about it.\n\nI?ve said this before in other articles and I?ll say\nit again and again - there is nothing bad about a\nsong relying on nothing but energy. In what way\ncould the lack of anything else possibly be an\nissue? What does it matter what the song would sound\nlike if you stripped away the energy if the song\ndoes have energy? And these songs really, really do.\n\nBut I suppose you want to know what it actually\nsounds like. Well, as always, we have a tendency to\ncompare albums to ones which are much better than\nthem, but we?ll do it again because as much as it\nwill make your imagination run wild and you?ll buy\nthe CD and inevitably be a bit disappointed with it,\nyou?ll eventually get over it and realize what a\ngood album this is. Anyway, there?s something to\nthis album that reminds me of some of Frank Blacks\nmore energetic music, and bar the Pixies I only\nreally know one Frank Black album intimately, and\nthat?s one of the best albums ever ? ?Teenager of\nthe Year?. So yeah, I?ve said it, this album reminds\nme of ?Teenager of the Year?. It?s not like it?s as\ndiverse or clever, but it does share some of the\nenergy, and it has those really satisfying power\nchord riffs we?ll never get enough of . The main\ndifference is that Frank Black is wise and old, and\nHot Gossip are young tykes capturing the spirit of\nthe age. So there, don?t come back to us saying ?oh\nrockfeedback, you said this album was as good as\n?Teenager of the Year? and it?s not - you are bad\npeople! You have forced me to spend my money wrong!\nMy mum says that you are just lay about journo liars\nwith no real prospects, failed musicians, the bottom\nof the food chain the bottom feeders of society!?.\nWell, we may be wannabe musicians, but liars we are\nnot - it?s not like you can tell us that it didn?t\nremind us of ?Teenager of the Year? now is it? The\npoint is it?s a bloody good album and, bless you,\nyou?re better off having it than not having it.\n\nAt times, the band have a real old school punk feel.\nThey seem to share some of the compassion and\nfeeling that XTC or the Skids obtained, the song\n?Prima? in particular sounds a lot like XTC, and\nit?s one that makes you feel good to be a person. It\nmakes you want to spend time with your friends and\nbe good to them. My life has been genuinely enriched\nby this crazy band and their tiny sounding drum kit,\nand their vaguely rockabilly bass. If you add up all\nthe seconds that they make you wait on this album it\ncomes to about three or five, a couple in the intro,\na couple in the middle of the last track, but at the\nsame time it has to be said that the band know\nrestraint and maybe it?s this that ironically keeps\nthe album so exciting. Very few people are excited\nby albums that just have one relentlessly fast sound\nfor half an hour. Often, it doesn?t work. And to do\nit well, like this, is a lot harder than a lot of\npeople think.\n\nIt?s not diverse in the way that say Mr. Bungle or\nTom Waits or Beck are, but there?s certainly enough\nin the way of little subtle nuances to keep you\ngoing, bits that sound like alien music, a bit that\nreminds you of Queens of the Stone Age, a bit that\nreminds you of At The Drive-Iin, a smattering of\nStrokes-style chords over the album, XTC, Frank\nBlack, a hint of Blur, some of the spirit of The\nFutureheads? I realize I?ve been skirting around the\nquestion of whether this is something I can really\nget my teeth sunk into. Well, I?m going to keep\nskirting, because I really want it to be, and I?m\ntrying to decide myself. Is this just a really\nbloody, bloody good album, or is this already a safe\nprediction for a potential highlight of 2007?\nLuckily I?ve been blessed with the time to decide.\nThe next paragraph will be me, a couple of months\nlater, keeping you posted.\n\nHmmm.\n\nHmmmmmmm.\n\nAfter a good few listens, I?m by no means tired of\nthis fantastic little album. It doesn?t have quite\nthe rocket fuel impact that it had before, but it\nturned out to be a fantastic album of songs, ones\nwith really mature melodies that still make you feel\ngood to be a person. Yes, yes you can get your teeth\nsunk into it, despite the fact that it?s only half\nan hour long. I?ll level with you - I?m not the sort\nof guy to mouth the words of songs that I like, but\nI have really enjoyed enjoying this album in the way\nI used to enjoy albums when I was fifteen. It?s a\nsafe purchase, and if this isn?t one of the\nhighlights of 2007, we have a very good year ahead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:827dcbf8e647a8039bdb9085b78736b44a7363d3","amp;dn":"Hot_Gossip-Angles-2007-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"827dcbf8e647a8039bdb9085b78736b44a7363d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,125,203,248,230,71,168,3,155,219,144,133,183,135,54,180,74,115,99,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
