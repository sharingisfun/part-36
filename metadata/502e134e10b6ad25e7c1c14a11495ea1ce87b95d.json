Located in MalmÃƒÂ¶, in southern Sweden, this orchestra has been working since 1979 and, under saxophonist/musical director Helge Albin, has collaborated with notable Americans such as Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Liebman and Michael Brecker, British composer Mike Westbrook and Danish saxophonist Lars MÃƒÂ¸ller - the band has even dedicated one of its programs to new arrangements of the John Lennon/Paul McCartney songbook.\n\nOn Tarantula Suite, reed player Cennet JÃƒÂ¶nsson takes the leadership. JÃƒÂ¶nsson composed and arranged an impressive eight-movement suite that stresses this big band's masterful collective musicianship and warm sound. JÃƒÂ¶nsson is a versatile composer and his compositions use the group's powerhouse energy and tight interplay, and its members' broad musical knowledge.
