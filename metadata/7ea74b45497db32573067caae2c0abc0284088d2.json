I found and ripped a lot of 7'' singles and some LPs I did not even remember I had them! At the end of the day with songs I found on external hard drive, I figured I have enough songs to put out another Rare Hits of The 80s installment. \n\nAnyhow for those who were mourning the death of this series, this constitutes some sort of resurrection! ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s load of cool songs and lots of synth! I have also thrown in the song Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On The RoofÃ¢â‚¬Å“,infamously known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stay The Second Time AroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½  that had haunted everyone as obscure as it could remain for 17 years. \n\nEnjoy and seed.\n\nTracks\n\n01 The Rezistance - Heavenly\n\n02 Jarvon Jol - The Dust Collector\n\n03 Johan Lindell - On The Roof\n\n04 Demars - Torn To Pieces\n\n05 Courage Of Lassie - Iron\n\n06 In Hill House - Sanctuary\n\n07 Alastair Riddell - Let Her Know\n\n08 Laws Of Motion - Not Enough\n\n09 The Moderns - The Only Game That Matters\n\n10 Erth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Introspection\n\n11 Fantasia - Pictures In My Mind\n\n12 FK9 - Strangers At The Heart\n\n13 M.A.O - Friend For A Day\n\n14 About Nine Times Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sun Cake\n\n15 I.Q. - Universe In Time\n\n16 Koo Dot Tah - Kill The Pain\n\n17 Inbase - Christine\n\n18 Life After Death - Isn't It Time\n\n19 Max Storm - Night Vision\n\n20 Technoquake - Trust In Me\n\n21 D'arc - Analysis\n\n22 New Age - First To Live First To Die\n\n23 Chandra - Opposite\n\n24 Zinc Orbie - Cover Girl\n\n25 Dancing Madly Backwards - Age of Communication\n\n26 Tame &amp; Talking - Fashion Fit\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea74b45497db32573067caae2c0abc0284088d2","amp;dn":"Rare+Hits+of+The+80%27s+Vol.+65","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea74b45497db32573067caae2c0abc0284088d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,167,75,69,73,125,179,37,115,6,124,170,226,192,171,192,40,64,136,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
