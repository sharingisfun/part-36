After all, the vocalist aided Portico on their enthralling recent LP and has previously worked with a host of other artists. McCleery has a relaxed, un-rushed temperament, with each song seeming to tumble out in a sweetly poetic fashion.\r\nThe Rotterdam-based singer songwriter has produced his definitive album. Pagodes is the deepest, most powerful work to date by a musician whose work has been described as like â€œMiles Davis, Massive Attack, John Martyn, Fink, and Radiohead wrapped up in one exquisitely produced sound.â€\r\nSeveral years of hard work making Pagodes has paid off in spades. Itâ€™s an album thatâ€™s difficult to turn away from, full of beautiful melody, futuristic production flourishes and lyrics that donâ€™t shy away from darkness, but always alight on uplifting conclusion.\r\n\r\nOpener â€œThis Idea of Usâ€ is a smouldering torch ballad, its string arrangement lending it gripping drama. Robert Wyattâ€™s â€œAge of Selfâ€ comes off as a song McCleery was born to sing, its lyrical content as relevant today as it was 30 years ago. The album moves into infectious percussive swing and melodic loops with â€œBallade,â€ a song that could have come from the LA-jazz hotbed surrounding Flying Lotus.\r\n\r\nPagodes marries all of this thrilling diversity via McCleeryâ€™s existential musings and his startling voice and playing. Itâ€™s unlikely youâ€™ll hear an album of such power from another singer songwriter anytime soon.\r\nRating 8/10\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01. This Idea Of Us.flac\r\n02.
