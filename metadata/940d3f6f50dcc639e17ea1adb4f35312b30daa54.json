The goal of their music is to find alternatives for the usual electronic schemes and to bring electronic music to a l\\\\\\'art pour l\\\\\\'art expressional level. The musical themes are based on the imaginary sounds from all across the galaxy, from the Earth to the very edge of the nowhere. They find monotonity the key of this kind of expression, but they work on a very wide scale of ideas which makes the music very rich and various behind the sense of monotonity. Their first album, \\\\\\&quot;Intergalactical Impressions\\\\\\&quot; released on the internet in 2011 tells all about how they think about the reformation of machinery sounds and the auditive portrait of the galaxy. Their second album, \\\\\\&quot;Divide by Zero\\\\\\&quot; is going to be released in 2012.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940d3f6f50dcc639e17ea1adb4f35312b30daa54","amp;dn":"RandomPetiProductions+-+Intergalactical+Impressions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940d3f6f50dcc639e17ea1adb4f35312b30daa54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,13,63,111,80,220,198,57,225,126,161,173,180,243,83,18,179,13,170,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
