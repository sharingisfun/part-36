Casey recounts how the Allies gathered critical intelligence, thwarted Germany&amp;#039;s atomic bomb development, and convinced German intelligence that the Normandy D-Day landings were to be a diversionary move while the main landing was to take place in Calais.\nCasey wrote this book because, as he said, &quot;I believe that it is important today to understand how clandestine intelligence, covert action, and organized resistance saved blood and treasure in defeating Hitler. These capabilities may be more important than missiles and satellites in meeting crises yet to come, and point to the potential for dissident action against the control centers and lines of communication of a totalitarian power.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833cbafc5d357cfcd3e0cdd540500123413f0215","amp;dn":"The+Secret+War+Against+Hitler+by+William+Casey+%28m4b%29+audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833cbafc5d357cfcd3e0cdd540500123413f0215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,60,186,252,93,53,124,252,211,224,205,213,64,80,1,35,65,63,2,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
