Luckily, you don't need to watch episode 8 before episode 9 etc!\n\nParker and Francesca live in a tiny condo. They want an open space with a chef's kitchen, and a grand staircase. The Property Brothers come to the rescue helping them find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a02834dd7efbfbaac53bd487490951f3b6018283","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s03e10.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a02834dd7efbfbaac53bd487490951f3b6018283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,40,52,221,126,251,251,170,197,59,212,135,73,9,81,243,182,1,130,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
