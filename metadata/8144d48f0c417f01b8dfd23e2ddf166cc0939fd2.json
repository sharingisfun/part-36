Basically, it is a catalog of &quot;pretty much&quot; every Phish show in circulation from before 10/07/2000 (Phish ended their first hiatus on 12/31/2002, and henceforth all recordings have been available via LivePhish).  Some are SBD, but by far mostly AUD; all have recording info; all are tagged, and even have artwork which corresponds to the ticket stub or venue; NONE of this is in FLAC:  This is exactly how this torrent was seeded about 5 years ago.  Some are 320, but most are lower bitrates.  However, the point is that many - if not most - of these recordings are not available at bt.etree.org...but if they are, I heartily suggest you head over there and download that and any other shows you like in wonderful FLAC.  If I find that any of these shows are available via bt.etree.org in FLAC I will upload that as well.  I am offering this collection up because it is comprehensive:  it really does comprise almost every Phish show in circulation from before the first hiatus.  I am really anal about FLAC/320 just like most of you, but the vast majority of these shows offered here are not presently available in the bittorrent community in any other format (although, once again, some are available at bt.etree.org, and some though Phish.com).\n\nThis is the seventh of roughly 50 torrents which comprise the whole collection, which goes from 1984 - 2000, and the first for 1994.\n\nHere are the shows included in this installment, 1994 part 01:\n\n1994-03-22 Modern Rock Live, Chicago IL (FM Interview)\n1994-04-04 The Flynn Theatre, Burlington VT (AUD-SBD)\n1994-04-05 The Metropolis, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (AUD)\n1994-04-06 Concert Hall, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AUD)\n1994-04-08 Recreation Hall, Penn State University, State College PA (AUD)\n1994-04-09 Broome County Arena, Binghamton NY (AUD-SBD)\n1994-04-10 Alumni Arena SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo NY (AUD)\n1994-04-11 Snivley Arena, University of New Hampshire, Durham NH (AUD)\n1994-04-13 Beacon Theatre, New York NY (AUD)\n1994-04-13 WNEW Studios, New York NY (FM)\n1994-04-14 Beacon Theatre, New York NY (AUD)\n1994-04-15 Beacon Theatre, New York NY (AUD)\n1994-04-16 Mullins Center, University of Massachusetts, Amherst MA (AUD)\n1994-04-17 Patriot Center, George Mason University, Fairfax VA (SBD)\n1994-04-18 Bob Carpenter Center, University of Delaware, Newark DE (AUD)\n1994-04-20 Virginia Horse Center, Lexington VA (AUD)\n1994-04-21 Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Winston-Salem NC (AUD)\n1994-04-22 Township Auditorium, Columbia SC (AUD)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8144d48f0c417f01b8dfd23e2ddf166cc0939fd2","amp;dn":"Phish+-+PMCLP+1994+Part+1+%28Pretty+Much+Complete+Live+Phish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8144d48f0c417f01b8dfd23e2ddf166cc0939fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,68,212,143,12,65,127,1,184,223,210,62,45,223,22,108,192,147,159,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
