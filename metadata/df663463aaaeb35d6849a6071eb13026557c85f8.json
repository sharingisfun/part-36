The audience of 600.000 was in a fiery and frenzied mood, after turning the festival into a political arena, trambling the fences and setting fire to structures. As Cohen followed the incendiary Jimi Hendrix, onlookers watched in awe as the Canadian folksinger-songwriter-poet-novelist quietly tamed the crowd.\n\nThis CD/DVD package contains the new beautiful film by Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Murray Lerner (From Mao to Mozart, Festival, Message to Love) as well as Cohens full performance on CD. Experience the energy, drama and magic of the 1970 Isle of Wight music festival through the songs, musings and poetry of a true legend - Leonard Cohen.\n\n\n\nLeonard Cohen - Live at the Isle of Wight 1970\n(CD+DVD New York Sony Music 2009)\n\nCD:\n\n 1.
