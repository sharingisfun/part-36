Two of the most popular would be 'Rapture Riders'(which mashed Blondie's 'Rapture' with The Doors' 'Riders On The Storm') and 'Proper Education' (DJ Eric Prydz meets Pink Floyd's 'Another Brick In The Wall'). There are others here that have been filling dancefloors recently including 'Franz Buffalo' (Malcolm McLarenn meets Franz Ferdinand), 'Passenger Fever' (Peggy Lee meets Iggy Pop), 'Flashing For Money' (Deep Dish and Dire Straits) and 'Horny As A Dandy' (Mousse T Vs. The Dandy Warhols). A brilliant collection that will surprise, shock and get you groovin'!.\nAmazon Review\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Frank Buffalo - - - Malcolm McLaren Vs Franz Ferdinand\n[02] Boogie Oogie Music - - - Madonna Vs A Taste Of Honey\n[03] Missing Groovejet - - - Everything But The Girl Vs Spiller\n[04] Horny As A Dandy [Mousse T's Radio Mix] - - - Mousse T.
