It is always ready yet only shows up when you need it.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ visual and intuitive!\nAshampoo Snap 6 is ideal for both beginners and experts. It features a highly readable and intuitive user-interface that makes most operations self-explanatory and the many visual cues \n\nmake also more advanced multi-step processes a breeze.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ comprehensive!\nAshampoo Snap 6 not only captures information but provides a myriad of functions and effects to add annotations and to further illustrate your point, making it ideal for educational and \n\nbusiness settings. You can even process existing images, no additional image editor required. Once your work is finished, distribute it right from within Ashampoo Snap 6.\n\nNew in Ashampoo Snap 6\n\nOur developers have made major improvements in the areas of performance, productivity and compatibility for a faster, more compatible product that will boost your productivity.\n\nPerformance\nWith full multi-core support and intelligent load balancing, all modifications and effects literally appear in a snap.\nProductivity\nFewer clicks, more results. Thanks to our new popups, most operations are now instantly accessible, sparing you the hassle of clicking through cascades of modal dialogs.\nReal-time adjustments and live previews\nNow, you can see all modifications as they happen. Feel free to experiment with different settings and present your information in style.\n\nAlways on the safe side Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Readjust with ease\nAs annotations and illustrations are added, already applied effects may begin to look inappropriate. With Ashampoo Snap 6, everything is readjustable. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like the drop shadow you \n\njust added? Readjust it to your needs.\n\nPick a color Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pick any color\nMany operations and effects allow you to set individual colors. Harmony among image colors is difficult to achieve when colors are selected manually and you will therefore often want to \n\nreuse existing colors for different operations. Ashampoo Snap 6 features a new color picker that comes in two different styles, integrated and standalone.\n\nThe integrated color picker allows you to select and reuse any existing color from your current image.\n\nThe standalone color picker goes one step further and allows you to select any color visible on your computer screens. This way, you can not only establish color balance within your edited \n\nimage but across other existing images.\n\nYou can even export collected colors to Adobe Photoshop compatible color profiles or export them as a single PNG color palette image for easy reviewing. The most recent color is \n\nautomatically exported to your system clipboard as a HEX string (e.g. #FBCDAD) for quick access.\n\nCapture bar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Less disruptive, more features\nThe new capture bar uses a smaller activation area and sits at the top-right of your screen by default. This makes erroneous activations less likely and causes less disruptions in your daily \n\nworkflow. Furthermore, the bar now features a toggle button to switch between single- and multi-shot capture modes as well a button for the new standalone color picker tool.\n\nVideo capturing\nWith Ashampoo Snap 6, you can capture stills from your webcam or apply a time-lapse effect to your video recordings that is great for tutorial videos.\n\nOne-click web-uploads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Your hub for digital images\nNo account or login required.

You may also download or \n\nshare the image through email, Facebook, Twitter or Google+ right from the linked website.\n\nCompatibility\nFull 32bit transparency support (RGBA)\nAshampoo Snap 6 now fully supports 32 bit translucency throughout the whole application and common tools such as Eraser or Blur Pen now operate on the alpha channel.\n\nSupport for SNAPDOC v2 format Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Revise and alter existing documents\nOnce you store your documents as SNAPDOC files you can always come back later and make changes to shadow and border settings or modify annotations and illustrations.\n\nImproved PDF support\nAshampoo Snap 6 uses a new PDF engine to load and save PDF documents that also works on Windows Server systems.\n\nSystem Requirements\nOperating System :- WindowsÃ‚Â® XP, Windows VistaÃ‚Â®, WindowsÃ‚Â® 7, WindowsÃ‚Â® 8\n\nInstall Notes :-\n1.
