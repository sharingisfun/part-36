This documentary looks at the people and the processes that keep the airport functioning, including the automated tracking devices holding records of where every package is stored in the six-storey warehouse and the work of the air-traffic and ground controllers.\n\n2)  Border Crossing \nBehind the scenes at San Ysidro, the main border crossing between Mexico and the United States, which is used by more than 40 million motorists and pedestrians each year. The documentary follows the authorities that patrol the boundary, including port director Frank Jaramillo and secondary team member Officer Baumsteiger, who rely on a variety of methods in their mission to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, drugs and other contraband items between the two countries.\n\n3)  Hotel \nBehind the scenes at the Venetian Palazzo hotel complex in Las Vegas, which has more than 7,000 rooms, employs around 8,500 workers and is home to America's highest-grossing restaurant. Executive chef Olivier Dubreuil deals with a problem oven as he and his staff prepare a buffet for 9,000 conference delegates and the casino is getting ready to launch the hotel's new in-house show Rock of Ages.\n\n4)  Train Station \nTokyo is perhaps the world's most crowded city, with 36 million residents, as well as commuters and visitors, all jostling for space. Every 24 hours, three million people pass through Shinjuku Station, where a train arrives every three seconds on one of 35 platforms. 25,000 trains roll through Shinjuku every day, which, were they placed end to end, would stretch from London to New York. With both overground and underground platforms, it is 15 times busier than London Waterloo, the busiest station in Britain. As well as the pressure of rush hour, the site must be prepared for the threat of earthquakes, typhoons and terrorists, and hundreds of staff sleep in pods equipped with inflatable-mattress alarms to ensure they are on time when the doors open at 4am.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3938/mlwm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3938/mlwm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/5428/82mt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/5428/82mt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/1086/mbpf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/1086/mbpf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/7182/9fb6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/7182/9fb6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/3077/urzm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/3077/urzm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4266/a3ca.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4266/a3ca.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8360/zx4p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8360/zx4p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/3504/oiza.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/3504/oiza.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/4406/89b8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/4406/89b8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/9186/dp57.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/9186/dp57.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/589/7ouu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/589/7ouu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6371/wovp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6371/wovp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;88c0e1efe0c8c4bca6b8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1994 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 680 M\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/ckswp4/worlds-busiest/episodeguide/series-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/ckswp4/worlds-busiest/episodeguide/series-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7472fc56739bfc6e7544aa9684bc4d21fbfc9a39","amp;dn":"Ch5+Worlds+Busiest+3of4+Hotel+540p+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7472fc56739bfc6e7544aa9684bc4d21fbfc9a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,114,252,86,115,155,252,110,117,68,170,150,132,188,77,33,251,252,154,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
