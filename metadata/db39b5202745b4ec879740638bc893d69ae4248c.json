Again, the music flows so naturally that the bridges and welds that join the African and African-American traditions on this record are never obvious, creating a seamless, wonderful album. The tracks were recorded live in the field, an approach that strengthens the intimate feel here, and there are numerous high points, including Africanized versions of Skip James' &quot;Cypress Grove Blues&quot; and Robert Petway's &quot;Catfish Blues&quot; that open new dimensions in each song without altering its original intent and tone. A version of &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot; (called &quot;Station Blues&quot; here) with the Rising Star Fife and Drum Band, and featuring ShardÃƒÂ© Thomas, the 12-year-old granddaughter of Othar Turner, is a particular delight in its ramshackle exuberance. Mississippi to Mali closes with a credible and moving take on Blind Willie Johnson's &quot;Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground&quot; that spotlights Harris' considerable acoustic slide skills. This is another fine album from a player whose reverence for the blues doesn't keep him from instilling the form with both joy and innovation.
