Peter Breck plays a ruthless journalist who believes that the quickest way to a Pulitzer Prize is to uncover the facts behind a murder at a mental hospital. To glean first-hand information, Breck pretends to go insane and is locked up in the institution. While pursuing his investigation, Breck is sidetracked by the loopy behavior of his fellow inmates. During a hospital riot, Breck is straightjacketed and subjected to shock treatment. By now almost as crazy as he's previously pretended to be, Breck begins imagining that his exotic-dancer girlfriend Constance Towers (a Samuel Fuller &quot;regular&quot;) is actually his sister! Typical of the Fuller ouevre, the characters in Shock Corridor are either saved or destroyed by their individual obsessions. \n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Shock Corridor.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 1555 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.66 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 1359 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.857\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.269\n      StreamSize : 976 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Video0 delay : 20ms\n      StreamSize : 137 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0057495\n\nEnglish audio, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by damascus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:765c5192d0e5ba91211465b8b83265a6bade324f","amp;dn":"Shock+Corridor+%281963%29+-+Samuel+Fuller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"765c5192d0e5ba91211465b8b83265a6bade324f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,92,81,146,208,229,186,145,33,20,101,184,184,50,101,166,186,222,50,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
