It can Optimize RAM to make your computer run faster and crash less often. and Increase your system performance by cleaning the content of your RAM. and lets you know the CPU information, memory usage, processes, and applications running on your computer.\n\nThis tool optimizes your RAM in adjustable, systematic periods and removes from RAM already closed programs which still occupy memory, thus making more free memory available to your system. While working with Windows XP (i have 512MB of RAM) i used to have only 100MB of free RAM before launch of this program and over 300MB after it. Yet again when some people may cry and write that it does nothing, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m using it one or two times per day!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ- wrote WinFuture.de about TweakRAM.\n\nTweakRAMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main feature is memory defragmentation (it solves the problem of scattered programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s code, so that your CPU doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to waste time on code lookup). Many programs, including Windows, accumulate huge amount of libraries, but not all of them are necessary. TweakRAM finds such blocks and unloads them to swap. When some of this data becomes necessary it is loaded back to RAM again. Sometimes it happens that when program exits not the whole memory it allocated is released. Thus the program is not running any more, but some memory canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be used by other programs. TweakRAM finds such memory leaks and flushes them to swap file, thus increasing size of free RAM.\n\nThe program shows a detailed information about total size of physical RAM, free memory and the percentage of its usage by the system. The same information is given about swap file and the business of the CPU.\n\nSince version 2.0 TweakRAM is supplied with its Application Startup Wizard which will help you configure optimal launch parameters of your applications. Now TweakRAM will automatically free needed size of RAM before/after program's launch.\n\nChanges in v7.1 Build 05.31\n- General change\n- Improved Windows 7/Vista 64-bit compatibility\n- fixed problem with false virus detection (Symatec, KAV)\n\nOperating Systems\nWindows 9x, Me, NT, 2K, XP, 2003, and Longhorn, Vista, 7\n\nInstall Notes\n1. Install the program and do not run.\n2. Copy the two cracks &quot;TweakRAM.exe&quot; &amp; &quot;Wizard.exe&quot; to prog dir. i.e. &quot;C:\\Program Files\\TweakRAM\\, and replace the originals.\n3. DONE!\n\n\n\n\n====================================================================================\n=Note: If You Have Problem With Any Of my Torrents Register To My Site And PM Me About Your  Problem.
