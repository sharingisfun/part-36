The show is presented by Sue Perkins and features a selection of regular panelists such as Armando Iannucci and regular writers Kevin Cecil, Andy Riley, Jon Holmes and Tony Roche. Panelists are given silly tasks by Perkins (in a manner not dissimilar to those given on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue by Humphrey Lyttelton) and are awarded pence for being funny. The player with the most money at the end of the show is given the chance to win 99p. It has been shown in some episodes that the gamble is compulsory, even if the winner has amassed a fortune of more than 99p in the game.\n\nThis is the second version of the panel game that was previously transmitted by BBC Radio 4 in 1998 as King Stupid. It was then hosted by William Vandyck and featured much the same line-up of comedians and satirists. The contestants were awarded points instead of pence.\n\nTransmission Dates &amp; Cast List available at popular online encyclopaedia www.wikipedia.com - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_99p_Challenge\n\nIt's ISIHAC for our generation. Except ISIHAC is also great for our generation. But this is the second best antidote to panel games ever. Well worth listening to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c6ee4357f44e48a8a1adabfd6c999abd4ec7f7","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+4+comedy+-+The+99p+Challenge+%28Iannucci%2C+Baynham%2C+Pegg%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c6ee4357f44e48a8a1adabfd6c999abd4ec7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,198,238,67,87,244,78,72,168,161,173,171,253,108,153,154,189,78,199,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
