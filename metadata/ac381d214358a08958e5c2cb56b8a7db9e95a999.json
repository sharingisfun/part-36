The demo garnered some attention for the band within the underground metal press circuit as well as helped them score gigs alongside Exodus, 3 Inches of Blood, Hate Eternal, Into Eternity and Aborted.\n\nIn November Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ05, the band began work on what would become their first proper full-length From Ashes with engineer John Haddad (Intronaut, Eyes of Fire, Phobia). The resulting nine songs paid special attention to not only brutality, but song craft as well and earned the band a remarkable international press response for a debut album. On the strength of From Ashes, they earned their first U.S. tour, a five-week juggernaut alongside Six Feet Under and Decapitated and played as support throughout their home state with the likes of Suffocation, Emperor, Immortal, Goatwhore and Decrepit Birth.\n\nIn 2007, Abysmal Dawn played a handful of festivals (LA Murderfest, Gathering of the Sick, Burning Star Metal Fest, and more) but most of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time was devoted to writing and rehearsing new material for their follow-up to From Ashes. By November, Abysmal Dawn had entered HaddadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new studio to begin the next full-length.\n\nAbysmal Dawn spent the next three-months in and out of the studio crafting Programmed to Consume. One by one, track by track, the pieces of this record came together, including brand new artwork once again from Par Olofsson. In February 2008, Abysmal Dawn signed a deal with Relapse Records, making Programmed to Consume the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label debut. Abysmal Dawn released this album on May 13 (May 19 internationally).\n\nAfter three years passed since the release Leveling the Plane of Existence they finally released their fourth studio album Obsolescence on October 28, 2014 via Relapse Records. According to Abysmal Dawn's frontman Charles Elliott, the title of the album was inspired by the term 'planned obsolescence', and is applied to all of mankind. In business terms, it means to manufacture a product that's made to break down after a certain amount of time so that it can be replaced.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Human Obsolescence\n02.
