J. Gordon\nPublisher: Collier Macmillan\nFormat: PDF\n\nCopyright Ã‚Â© 1961 by William J. J. Gordon\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number: 61-10237\nManufactured in the United States of America\nFirst Collier Books Edition 1968\nFifth Printing 1973\n\nSynectics: An exciting new method for developing creative solutions to the problems of business, science, the arts, and education.\n\nThis book is the exciting result of some fifteen years of experimentation in training creative capacity. It not only identifies the psychological processes involved in creativity but also explores the methods by which creative potential in individuals and groups can be stimulated and directed to the solution of specific problems.\n\nSynectics theory, which holds that creative efficiency in people can be markedly increased if they understand the psychological process by which they operate, is effectively demonstrated in dozens of case studies of groups in actual problem-solving sessions.\n\nWith broad implications for the sciences, the arts, and education, Synectics has proven particularly meaningful and provocative to businessmen and executives, whose livelihood depends on the development of new ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28e4fc8ccb2316cff41ec27e4e785249a7f00301","amp;dn":"Synectics%3A+The+Development+of+Creative+Capacity+by+William+JJ+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28e4fc8ccb2316cff41ec27e4e785249a7f00301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,228,252,140,203,35,22,207,244,30,194,126,78,120,82,73,167,240,3,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
