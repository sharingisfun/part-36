For generations the village youths are stolen from their families and delivered as sacrifice to a mythical beast - the Minotaur, that dwells beneath a great palace. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love in an earlier sacrifice is convinced that the beast isn't real and that his girl still lives as a slave within the palace. His father Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go but Theo is driven by blind rage. He devises a plan and is taken with the other youths who are dragged screaming from their families. \n\nGeneral Information\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415160/\nComplete name: Minotaur.2006.DVDRiP.AC3-2.0.XviD-SiC.avi\nFormat: AVI\nFormat/Info: Audio Video Interleave\nFile size: 1.47 GiB\nDuration: 1h 27mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 395 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b045d2b82eb5476dd08082183bb5c57777a33cd3","amp;dn":"Minotaur+2006+DVDRiP+AC3-5+1+XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b045d2b82eb5476dd08082183bb5c57777a33cd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,69,210,184,46,181,71,109,208,128,130,24,59,181,197,119,119,163,60,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
