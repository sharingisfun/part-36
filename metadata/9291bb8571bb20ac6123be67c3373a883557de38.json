Born in Sao\nPaulo, Brazil, he worked as an architect, A&amp;R man and graphic\ndesigner before beginning to produce music for major record\nlabels in the mid nineties. He worked with such musical\nluminaries as Pato Banton and Garth Brooks prior to making his\nown music and starting his own label, Megamusic. Michael Mayer\nthen plucked him from obscurity, signing him to Kompakt in\n2005, where he released popular debut EP, ArquipÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å¾lago, later\nthe same year. In 2007 he released his first album,\nChromophobia, which gained universal recognition due to the\nadept combination of commercial cross-over hits like Beautiful\nLife and underground club-pleasers like Terminal.\n\nTake My Breath Away follows a similar theme; the title track\nstarts things off all moody and minimal, before Atomic Soda\nprovides the album's big, dark, club monster. The listener is\nthen treated to the benefits of all those years in the studio\npolishing other people's turds. Tracks like Colours and No\nTurning Back demonstrate his knack for coming up with\nincredibly catchy melodies and riffs, whilst maintaining a\ndistinctly well made, non-commercial feel.\n\nThe record's structure is much like that of a good DJ set:\nthere's a powerful beginning, then a more relaxed and\naccessible middle with Les Enfants and Besides evoking the\nbest of artists like Fourtet or Ulrich Schnauss. And in stark\ncontrast they are followed by penultimate duo Ballroom and\nEggplant, which take things firmly back to the dance floor,\nbefore Godet provides a fittingly serene end.\n\nWhat is so refreshing about Boratto's work, is that for once\nwith a dance music album, there is no shortage of inspiration.\nEvery song has something new to enjoy; in fact most have\nseveral things. Here's hoping that this album gains him the\nrespect and success he deserves.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9291bb8571bb20ac6123be67c3373a883557de38","amp;dn":"Gui_Boratto-Take_My_Breath_Away-%28Advance%29-2009-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9291bb8571bb20ac6123be67c3373a883557de38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,145,187,133,113,187,32,172,97,35,190,103,195,55,58,136,53,87,222,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
