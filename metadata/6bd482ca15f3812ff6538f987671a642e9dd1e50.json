Allen and Steve Lehman. Add to that list a trio led by bassist\nand composer Adam Lane, joined here by Mark Whitcage on alto saxophone and\nclarinet and Lou Grassi on drums. This is a lean and strong trio that works well\ntogether, beginning with &quot;The Last of the Beboppers&quot; which is nice raw free-bop,\nfeaturing Whitcage's strong alto saxophone sounding good over swirling bass and\ndrums. &quot;Sanctum&quot; has a mellow and vaguely Middle Eastern feel, very open\nsounding and mysterious as is &quot;Like Nothing Else&quot; which has a low and caustic\nbowed bass opening that evolves into an ominous, probing and swirling\nimprovisation. &quot;Chichi Rides the Tiger&quot; is a strong performance with cool high\nsounding reed improvisation. Fast paced and interesting, this is one of the of\nthe highlights of the disc. &quot;Avanti Galoppi&quot;, &quot;Marshall&quot; and especially &quot;Five\nO'Clock Follies&quot; from the latter half of the disc are excellent as well,\nsounding akin to the tough, streamlined saxophone trios that Sonny Rollins led\nin the 1950's. This is interesting music that blurs the intersection between\nmainstream and avant-garde jazz in an intelligent and thoughtful fashion.\n\n--\n\nby Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=30257&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=30257&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Stef\n\ndi Vincenzo Roggero (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3201&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor YahvÃƒÂ© M. de la Cavada (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2008-09-01#lane_grassi_whitecage-dru&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2008-09-01#lane_grassi_whitecage-dru&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd482ca15f3812ff6538f987671a642e9dd1e50","amp;dn":"Adam+Lane%2C+Lou+Grassi%2C+Mark+Whitecage+-+Drunk+Butterfly+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd482ca15f3812ff6538f987671a642e9dd1e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,212,130,202,21,243,129,47,246,83,143,152,118,113,166,66,233,221,30,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
