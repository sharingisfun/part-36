While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia - who is slowly regaining her powers - it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f109ccd865f0e56a8488b4ab9b085d4756cb3dfb","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Vol.+23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f109ccd865f0e56a8488b4ab9b085d4756cb3dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,9,204,216,101,240,229,106,132,136,180,171,155,8,93,71,86,203,61,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
