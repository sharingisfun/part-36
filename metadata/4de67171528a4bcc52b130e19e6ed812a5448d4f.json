But when this born-and-bred city girl is suddenlyÃ¢â‚¬â€and quite literallyÃ¢â‚¬â€swept off her feet by a sexy cowboy on horseback, she realizes that the country life has some serious (and seriously steamy!) possibilities. That is, until she finds out exactly who her smokinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-hot wrangler really is.\n\nCowboy and Tribal lawyer Jake Lodge is desperately trying to block the development. And if that means playing hardballÃ¢â‚¬â€and being every inch the shark lawyerÃ¢â‚¬â€so be it. But Sophie is a distraction he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect. A distraction that makes his blood burn.\n\nTwo different worlds. Two opposing sides. And when they finally give into the exquisite temptation, the consequences will shake the foundations of both of their livesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nUnder the Covers (Maverick Montana #2) by Rebecca Zanetti (May 27th 2013)\n\nOpposites donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t attract. They ignite.\n\nThe small Montana town near the Kooskia reserve seemed like the perfect place for Juliet Montgomery to hide from her not-so-law-abiding family. But when her peace is shattered by a break-in and threatening phone calls, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear someone back in New York knows where she is. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to plan her getaway, and fastÃ¢â‚¬â€but first, she needs to tie up a few loose ends. Namely, finding out exactly what the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexy cowboy sheriff is hiding in his holster...\n\nSheriff Quinn Lodge has enough demons of his own to know when someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding something. Clearly, he needs to do a thorough investigation to uncover whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beneath JulietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uptight, city-girl exteriorÃ¢â‚¬â€preferably one piece of clothing at a time. But when their chemistry goes from fizzy to full-on explosive, things start getting complicated. How can Juliet stay beneath the covers with Quinn, when doing so means blowing her cover?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de67171528a4bcc52b130e19e6ed812a5448d4f","amp;dn":"Maverick+Montana+Series+%281-2%29+by+Rebecca+Zanetti+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de67171528a4bcc52b130e19e6ed812a5448d4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,230,113,113,82,138,75,204,82,177,48,225,158,110,216,18,165,68,141,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
