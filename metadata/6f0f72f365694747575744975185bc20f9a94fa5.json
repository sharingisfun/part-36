They originated in Denver, Colorado.\n\nCorbetta founded the band with guitarist Bob Webber of the Moonrakers; the other initial bandmembers were drummer Bob MacVittie and rhythm guitarist Veeder Van Dorn III, also from the Moonrakers, plus bassist Bob Raymond.[1] The Moonrakers had previously released 4 singles on Tower;[2] three of their songs are collected on the Colorado garage rock compilation album Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 18, and another was released earlier on the Pebbles Volume 10 LP.\n\nThe band was originally known as Chocolate Hair. They changed their name to Sugarloaf, a mountain outside of Boulder, Colorado, [3] when they received their first recording contract.\n\nThey are best known for two songs, both of which hit the top 10 charts in the United States: &quot;Green-Eyed Lady&quot; in the autumn of 1970 (their biggest hit, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard chart) and &quot;Don't Call Us, We'll Call You&quot; in 1975 (US No. 9).\n\nOther songs which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 were &quot;Mother Nature's Wine&quot; (1971), &quot;Tongue in Cheek&quot; (1971), and &quot;Stars In Our Eyes&quot; (1976). In addition, &quot;West of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Myra Myra&quot; were not hit singles, but received modest airplay at the time of their release on album rock radio stations.\n\nThe 1975 album Don't Call Us, We'll Call You was a re-release of their 1973 album I Got A Song, with one of the tracks on the earlier album replaced by the title track of the later album, which had become a hit single.\n\nThe song &quot;Don't Call Us, We'll Call You&quot; is notable because it contained a practical joke at the expense of CBS Records, which had just turned them down for a recording contract. The song includes the sound of a touch-tone telephone number being dialed near the beginning and ending of the song. Those numbers were an unlisted phone number at CBS Records and a public number at the White House respectively. In addition, the recording includes snippets of the guitar riff of The Beatles' &quot;I Feel Fine,&quot; Stevie Wonder's &quot;Superstition,&quot; and a line of dialogue from Wolfman Jack stating the call sign of a radio station; numerous tracks of this line were cut to match local markets.\n\nCorbetta later went on to perform with the group Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes (best known for their hit &quot;Get Dancin'&quot;). In 1980, he became a member of The Four Seasons. He currently performs with The Classic Rock All-Stars, a touring supergroup of hitmakers from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0f72f365694747575744975185bc20f9a94fa5","amp;dn":"Sugarloaf%2FSpaceship+Earth+%5B1970%2C71%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0f72f365694747575744975185bc20f9a94fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,15,114,243,101,105,71,71,87,87,68,151,81,133,188,32,249,169,79,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
