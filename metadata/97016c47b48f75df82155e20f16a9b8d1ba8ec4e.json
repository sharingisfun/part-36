Apartheid is crumbling, Nelson Mandela has just been released from prison and thirteen-year-old Spud Milton is about to start his first year at an elite boys-only boarding school. Cursed with embarrassingly dysfunctional parents, a nutty granny and a dormitory full of strange characters, Spud has his hands full trying to adapt to his new home. With only his wits and his diary, he takes readers on a rowdy boarding school romp full of illegal midnight swims, catastrophic cricket matches, ghost-busting escapades, girls and disastrous holidays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97016c47b48f75df82155e20f16a9b8d1ba8ec4e","amp;dn":"John+Van+De+Ruit+-+Spud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97016c47b48f75df82155e20f16a9b8d1ba8ec4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,1,108,71,180,143,117,223,130,21,94,32,241,106,155,141,27,168,236,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
