They are back for another wild adventure as they try to save the world . . . and themselves. The Uber-Director sees the group of friends as his opportunity to become a billionaire: he seizes his chance to cash in that lucrative price tag by planning a worldwide auction with the children being offered to the highest bidder. But first his mutant army must track them down and capture them u which won't be easy. Meanwhile, in hiding from their predators, all six of them wake one evening to find they are being given an important mission - to save the world from global warming.
