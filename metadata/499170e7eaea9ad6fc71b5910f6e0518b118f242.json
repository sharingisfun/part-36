Mac (February 20th 2013)\n\nLife can be cruel. People can be ruthless and evil. The world can be cold and uninviting. No one knows these things better than Josephine Geroux. By her own definition, she is a twenty-five year old Ã¢â‚¬Å“nobody with nothing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and she is content to stay that way. Growing up an orphan has made her tough and indifferent to the people around her until she meets a strangely familiar man with a face that haunts her for reasons she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand.\n\nDespite the pain that will inevitably ensue, she makes it her mission to discover what parts of her tragic puzzle she is missing. On her journey to discovering why the she feels an alarming connection to an absolute stranger, her greatest fear is reawakening the demons and darkness from the past that will surely overtake her if she lets her guard down. \n\nLittle does Josephine know that the past should be the least of her worries. She is toying with a man who has already broken her heart once. She just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize it.\nAlthough she makes it a point to avoid interactions with others, JosephineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life becomes entangled with the enigmatic stranger. Before she realizes it, she has given herself over to the one person who is close enough to wreck her.\n\nBook 2: Restore Me (Wrecked #2)by J.L. Mac (April 29th 2013) \n\nNavigating the world alone is all Josephine Geroux has ever known. Life altering tragedy struck early on for her. She endured an admirable struggle through her youth and learned the hard way how to adapt and survive. She managed to arrive at adulthood in one piece in spite of it all. \n\nAfter such chaos, maintaining a life free of complications is a priority for her. \nEverything changed when a man with amber eyes came through her door and claimed her heart. She fell hard in more ways than one. The pull between Jo and Damon seemed like fate bringing things full circle.\n\nWith another devastating loss looming, Jo fights to hold on to the very thing that brought her to her knees. She finds herself torn between a promising future and clinging to a devastating past.\nBut thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the most worrisome problem on her hands. \n\nShe must convince more than just herself to let the past stay in the past, where it belongs, but on her journey to find closure and resolution, she does the exact opposite. An old wound caused by a heinous act becomes exposed for what it is. The truth is catastrophic and Jo is helpless, watching as the ruins of her fragile world endure more turmoil. \n\nCan something conceived from tragedy and malice end well? Can something so completely poisoned conquer adversity? Jo is left to make a decision; accept the circumstances she finds herself in or fight with unwavering ferocity to restore what has been damaged.\n*Restore Me is the second book in the Wrecked series*\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:499170e7eaea9ad6fc71b5910f6e0518b118f242","amp;dn":"Wrecked+Series+%281-2%29+by+J.L.+Mac+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"499170e7eaea9ad6fc71b5910f6e0518b118f242","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,145,112,231,234,234,154,214,252,113,181,145,15,110,5,24,177,24,242,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
