It's a bit more up and down than you'd expect from an album with &quot;chill&quot; on the cover, but things never get too chaotic. Joyce focuses on the more organic with a few modern-day electronic artists snuck in (ZUCO 103, In Soul). Marcus Vinicius does the &quot;soft-mixing&quot; and his sense of pace in near perfect (light and acoustic bossa nova to start the discs, trippy electronica to finish them). The only speed bump is a complex Hermeto Pascoal number, which is great, but it may lead some to question how &quot;chill&quot; it is. Those looking for a little unwinding with music that isn't vapid and has that slinky Brazilian flavor should be very pleased.\n\n\nA collection of sexy, steamy soul bossa tracks with the sounds of Brazil. With some of the most-recognizable names, not to mention many of the others present from the many wonders of Brazilian music, this is the perfect compilation to chill out to.\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a10f9685e99e6777b5497f40e29c30687194b4ff","amp;dn":"CHILL+BRAZIL+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a10f9685e99e6777b5497f40e29c30687194b4ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,15,150,133,233,158,103,119,181,73,127,64,226,156,48,104,113,148,180,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
