I mean letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s be honest, now.a.daze youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re lucky if you download a cd with two singles on it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but 8? No way! And yet, here it is... \n\nHollywood Ending, released in the summer of 2008, is made up of eight skilfully-crafted, unadulterated rock songs, ranging the gamut from passionate ballad to kickass guitar anthem. And yes, the results are in... 10 out of 10 blind listening sessions have concluded ...thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no @!* way this band is staying indie... In fact, they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound indie at all!!\n\nBut the one thing that really makes your head spin about this album is the talent behind it, and the focus of the band members. With dig deep, passionate vocals, the power of three rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ guitars, heavy bass and the craziest @%! drummer relentlessly thrashing his skins (not to mention the sweat flying around on stage) - theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the real deal. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stoked and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in it to win it. Says lead vocalist Tim Morrison, Ã¢â‚¬Å“you gotta go big or go homeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ full stop....and from the sound of things... they ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t goinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ home anytime soon!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2109406439d32ebcb1caf2928027b03334ce3b98","amp;dn":"Age+of+Daze+-+Hollywood+Ending+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2109406439d32ebcb1caf2928027b03334ce3b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,9,64,100,57,211,46,188,177,202,242,146,128,39,176,51,52,206,59,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
