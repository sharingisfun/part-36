Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who has come to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians. The novel explores his interaction withÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the eventual transformation ofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Earth culture. The title seems to be an allusion to the phrase in Exodus 2:22 (in the Biblical Book of Exodus). According to Heinlein, the novel\\\\\\'s working title was The Heretic. Several later editions of the book have promoted it as \\\\\\&quot;The most famous Science Fiction Novel ever written.\\\\\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7eb9fa0cb9c79e3ee44eab10bb778dc7b28d28a","amp;dn":"Stranger+in+a+Strange+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7eb9fa0cb9c79e3ee44eab10bb778dc7b28d28a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,235,159,160,203,156,121,227,238,68,234,177,11,183,120,220,123,40,210,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
