This movie was withdrawn from circulation after Ainu actors complained about the way they were portrayed.\n\nIshiro Honda, fresh from his triumph with Gojira/Godzilla, decided to tackle the Yeti. This is decidedly a monster movie in the tradition of King Kong; it lacks the anguished subtext and noir photography of Gojira, or the creepiness of the snowy wastes in The Abominable Snowman (1957) - which also had an environmental philosophical theme.\n\nStill, Honda has legions of admirers, and this is an important milestone in his career. It is not to be confused with Half Human, a bastardized version of this movie with clumsy English-language inserts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc220ab8e777177cd216992214b3bbbe0d40ab81","amp;dn":"Ju+Jin+Yuki+Otoko+-+Ishiro+Honda+-+Original+Yeti+film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc220ab8e777177cd216992214b3bbbe0d40ab81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,34,10,184,231,119,23,124,210,22,153,34,20,179,187,190,13,64,171,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
