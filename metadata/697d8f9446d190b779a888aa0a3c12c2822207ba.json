The fittest have indeed survived--even in places where no living creatures could be thought to exist. In a stunning six-part miniseries, Nature presents a compelling new vision of the epic forces that have shaped the Earth. \n\nMore than three years in the making, &quot;Triumph of Life&quot; combines dramatic storytelling with powerful, ground-breaking scientific ideas in a sweeping story about survival and the survivors--the winners, for the moment at least, in an eternal battle.\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: David Heeley &amp; Suzanne Weinert\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Triumph Of Life-Winning Teams\nYear:  2001\nFile Size: 742 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:51\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1918 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (External English)\n \n\n  \n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:697d8f9446d190b779a888aa0a3c12c2822207ba","amp;dn":"Triumph+Of+Life-Winning+Teams-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"697d8f9446d190b779a888aa0a3c12c2822207ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,125,143,148,70,209,144,183,121,168,136,170,10,60,18,194,130,34,7,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
