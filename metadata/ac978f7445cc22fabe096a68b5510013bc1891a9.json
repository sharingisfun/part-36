More than 60,000 screaming fans stormed Havana's Anti-Imperialist Plaza to catch the May 6th show and the band gave an absolutely electrifying performance, tearing through a free two-and-a-half hour show. The historic event is captured on the Epic/Interscope release LIVE IN CUBA, a deluxe 18-song double-disc package that includes a DVD featuring a 30-minute documentary, live concert footage and an additional TV special on the event, along with a bonus live CD taken from Audioslave's recent AOL Sessions performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac978f7445cc22fabe096a68b5510013bc1891a9","amp;dn":"audioslave+%40+cuba+%28entire+show%29+-+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac978f7445cc22fabe096a68b5510013bc1891a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,151,143,116,69,204,34,250,190,9,106,104,181,81,0,19,188,24,145,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
