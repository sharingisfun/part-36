Now Commander Adama of the Battlestar \n              Galatica and President Laura Roslin lead a ragtag fleet of \n              refugees in a supposed search for the fabled lost thirteenth \n              colony, Earth. However, the dangers they face are many which\n              compound an already difficult situation. In addition to the Cylons\n              hunting and attacking the fleet in space, their infiltrator units \n              carry out a more subtle plot even as their former unwitting pawn, \n              Gaius Baltar, helps in the hunt for them while hiding both his own\n              guilt and the strange presence that haunts his every thought. If \n              that wasn't enough, the fleet also faces internal political \n              conflict in which the rabble-rousing figure, Tom Zarek, is merely \n              the loudest dissenting voice. In the midst of these trials however, \n              clues begin to appear that suggest that Adama's simple bluff about\n              Earth may be more truthful than anyone could have guessed.  \n              Written by Kenneth Chisholm (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d4bfb7bcbda7bcbbb894a6bbb3b1a6a7fab7bbb9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) [from IMDb site]\n\nTitle:                 battlestar-galactica-s01e01.avi\nData source:           DVD\nRuntime:               00:45:15\n\nVideo format:          NTSC\nFPS:                   29.970\nSize:                  592 x 448\nVideo codec:           xvid\n\nLanguage:              en\nAudio codec:           ac3\nChannels:              2\nSample rate:           48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps):  224\n\nSubtitle 1:            battlestar-galactica-s01e01.ptb.srt\nLanguage:              pt\n\nSubtitle 2:            battlestar-galactica-s01e01.eng.srt\nLanguage:              en\n\nDVD::Rip\nTranscode\nUbuntu Linux 9.10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73835230d9692b2b68479108b5baaa002f4f743","amp;dn":"battlestar-galactica-s01e03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73835230d9692b2b68479108b5baaa002f4f743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,56,53,35,13,150,146,178,182,132,121,16,139,91,170,160,2,244,247,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
