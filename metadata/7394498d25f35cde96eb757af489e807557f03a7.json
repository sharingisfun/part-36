This Agency is run by human-hybrid clones known as Bioroid, made from the genes of the best and brightest.\n\nFormer Los Angeles S.W.A.T. officer Deunan Knute and her cyborg partner Briareos, both become residents of Olympus after being scouted by ES.W.A.T., a special counter-terrorist division of the Global Police.\n\nOne such terrorist group which they fight is the Human Liberation Front, which attacked Olympus in the midst of the launch of the Ark Program, a plan to entrust the future of humanity to Bioroids. However, subsequent investigations will reveal that someone else had been manipulating the Front from behind the scenes.
