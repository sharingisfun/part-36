The period covered here is 1989-1993, collecting most of the B-sides from Automatic and Honey's Dead. It's not quite complete, missing at least four B-sides (&quot;Subway,&quot; &quot;In the Black,&quot; &quot;Terminal Beach,&quot; &quot;I'm Glad I Never&quot;) and a small number of remixes. \n&quot;Snakedriver&quot; provides the best reason for picking this up, a classic Jesus and Mary Chain song in the sleazy, bluesy, &quot;Beach Boys on lots of smack&quot; mold. &quot;Write Record Release Blues&quot; skewers the Man while poking fun at themselves; one major demand: &quot;Leave me in peaceful abject misery.&quot; The radio mix of &quot;Reverence&quot; doesn't sound any friendlier than the original, adding two minutes to the wailing beast and turning it into the dance remix of Big Black's &quot;Kerosene&quot; that it really is. Desperate, immature malevolence doesn't get any better. \nSpeaking of reverence, this offers another clutch of covers, including Leonard Cohen's &quot;Tower of Song&quot; (pleasantly dirgeful), the Temptations' &quot;My Girl&quot; (pointless), Willie Dixon's &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; (maxed vocal distortion), the 13th Floor Elevators' &quot;Reverberation&quot; (jug-free), and Jerry Reed's &quot;Guitarman&quot; (doesn't quite work). \nOther highlights in this decent package include the nasty &quot;Lowlife&quot; and an eight-minute version of &quot;Sidewalking&quot; that should please those who like the sludgy battering of the regular version.
