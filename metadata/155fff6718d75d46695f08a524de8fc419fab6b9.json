She followed with two other smash bestsellers: Cherry and Lit, which were critical hits as well.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years Karr has also taught the form, winning graduate teaching prizes for her highly selective seminar at Syracuse, where she mentored such future hit authors as Cheryl Strayed, Keith Gessen, and Koren Zailckas. In The Art of Memoir, she synthesizes her expertise as professor and therapy patient, writer and spiritual seeker, recovered alcoholic and â€œblack belt sinner,â€ providing a unique window into the mechanics and art of the form that is as irreverent, insightful, and entertaining as her own work in the genre.\r\n\r\nAnchored by excerpts from her favorite memoirs and anecdotes from fellow writersâ€™ experience, The Art of Memoir lays bare Karrâ€™s own process. (Plus all those inside stories about how she dealt with family and friends get toldâ€” and the dark spaces in her own skull probed in depth.) As she breaks down the key elements of great literary memoir, she breaks open our concepts of memory and identity, and illuminates the cathartic power of reflecting on the past; anybody with an inner life or complicated history, whether writer or reader, will relate.\r\n\r\nJoining such classics as Stephen Kingâ€™s On Writing and Anne Lamottâ€™s Bird by Bird, The Art of Memoir is an elegant and accessible exploration of one of todayâ€™s most popular literary formsâ€”a tour de force from an accomplished master pulling back the curtain on her craft","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:155fff6718d75d46695f08a524de8fc419fab6b9","amp;dn":"Mary+Karr%2C+%26quot%3BThe+Art+of+Memoir%26quot%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"155fff6718d75d46695f08a524de8fc419fab6b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,95,255,103,24,215,93,70,105,95,8,165,36,222,143,196,25,250,182,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
