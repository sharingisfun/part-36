Foodborne illness is a major cause of disease and some infections can be fatal. With the rise of globalisation, trends towards minimal processing, and changes in food consumption patterns, the food industry, food safety agencies, and public health officials must coordinate their activities to monitor the interactions between foodborne pathogens and food consumers. This important collection reviews vital issues in the relationship between consumers and foodborne bacteria, viruses and parasites, and surveys how interactions between microorganisms and their human hosts influence foodborne disease.\r\n\r\nPart one considers factors which increase the risk of exposure to foodborne hazards, exploring issues such as the demographics of our changing population and trends in agricultural management. Part two examines human host factors which influence foodborne disease. It includes chapters on non-specific host defences, immunity to foodborne pathogens and heightened susceptibility to foodborne disease due to underlying illness or pregnancy. The final part of the book reviews the mechanisms used by numerous pathogenic agents to invade, evade, colonise and reproduce in the human host. Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA), essential for the protection of public health, is also covered.\r\n\r\nWith its distinguished editor and international team of contributors, Food consumption and disease risk: consumer-pathogen interactions will be an essential reference for microbiologists, R&amp;D and QA staff in the food industry.\r\n\r\nConsiders factors that increase the risk of exposure to foodborne hazards\r\nExamines the human factors that influence disease\r\nDistinguished editor and international team of contributors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aaf3b7772cf7a136ad1b802b170d4f49fb42062","amp;dn":"Food+Consumption+and+Disease+Risk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aaf3b7772cf7a136ad1b802b170d4f49fb42062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,175,59,119,114,207,122,19,106,209,184,2,177,112,212,244,159,180,32,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
