He seemed some elvish dwarf.\nBut you forgot soon this nuance when those long hands started to explore the piano keyboard.\nIt was after that concert that I started to dig seriously jazz music.\n\nBuilding up this discography I've noticed that he's not remembered so much nowadays.\nProbably cause he's french and not anglo-saxon.\nProbably cause he left us too soon.\nI dont know...\nI found a great mess about the real extension of his discography, the release dates and so on.\nI've tried to put together all the material I found - and anyway you won't find all this stuff together anywhere else :)\nThe discography is pretty complete in his main albums and with several collaborations too. \nYou won't find some of the usual compilation marmalades that labels usually do when they want to reboost their sales.\nSimply I could not find them all.\nBut I found some rare live bootlegs with more than sufficient quality that I deem far more valuable.\nJazz music can be tasted at its best when played alive. :)\n\nThere are 55 albums.\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps for most of them.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums.\nEnjoy :)\n\nAlbums List:\n\n1980 - Flash - 256\n1981 - Date With Time\n1981 - Michel Petrucciani\n1982 - Darn that Dream - 192\n1982 - Estate\n1983 - Oracle's Destiny\n1984 - 100 Hearts\n1984 - Note 'n Notes\n1985 - Pianism\n1986 - Power Of Three\n1987 - Michel Plays Petrucciani\n1989 - Music\n1991 - Playground\n1992 - Brecon Jazz Festival\n1993 - Live in Stuttgart - 192\n1993 - North Sea Jazz Festival\n1993 - Promenade With Duke\n1994 - Live (At The Arsenal 1991)\n1994 - Marvellous\n1994 - The Best Of Michel Petrucciani - The Blue Note Years\n1995 - Au Theatre Des Champs-Elysees\n1996 - Jazzbaltica 1996\n1996 - Live in Bologna\n1996 - Musica Jazz 1996-07 - 192\n1997 - Both Worlds\n1997 - Solo Live\n1997 - Trio In Tokyo\n1998 - Jazz Festival de Nice 1998\n1998 - Michel Petrucciani Sextet - NSJF 1998-07-10\n1999 - A Michel ...
