All the acts here -- Pete Wentz and Patrick Stump \nof Fall Out Boy, Jared Leto of 30 Seconds to Mars, Gerard Way of My \nChemical Romance, Jade Puget of AFI and Cure opener 65 Days of Static -- \ndo demonstrate some clear debt to the Cure, which manifests not in a \ndoomy, sultry fashion but oddly, in mixes that are somewhat reminiscent of \nearly-'90s Cure B-sides -- an appropriate enough sound given the ages of the \nmusicians, but not quite the classic Cure that provides their inspiration \n(although to be honest, apart from parts of MCR and AFI, none of these \nbands really sounds that much like the Cure, they just like Robert Smith's \nmakeup). As it's glitzy, splashy stuff that only gleams on the surface, it's not \ngoing to appeal much to longtime Cure fans -- it sounds more now than they \nhave in a long time, for better or worse -- but it's really not meant for them: \nit's for the hardcore fans of the remixers, who will now maybe buy the new \nCure album because Gerard or Jared remixed a couple cuts from it.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 9/16/2008\nLabel: Geffen Records\nCatalog Number: 001190502\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06961baf09eb5946b5e93d78e465455ba5323535","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Hypnagogic+States+EP+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06961baf09eb5946b5e93d78e465455ba5323535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,150,27,175,9,235,89,70,181,233,61,120,228,101,69,91,165,50,53,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
