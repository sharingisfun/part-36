Barack Obama casts himself as a disciple of reason and sticks to one refrain above all others: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pragmatist, opposed to the ideology and dogma of the right, solely concerned with Ã¢â‚¬Å“what works.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liberals follow his lead, spouting countless clichÃƒÂ©s such as:\n\nOne manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrorist is another manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freedom fighter: Sure, if the other man is an idiot. Was Martin Luther King Jr. a terrorist? Was Bin Laden a freedom fighter?\nViolence never solves anything: Really? It solved our problems with the British empire and ended slavery.\nBetter ten guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer: So you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind if those ten guilty men move next door to you?\nDiversity is strength: Cool.The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!\nWe need complete separation of church and state: In other words all expressions of faith should be barred from politics Ã¢â‚¬Â¦except when they support liberal programs.\nWith humor and passion, Goldberg dismantles these and many other Trojan Horses that liberals use to cheat in the war of ideas. He shows that the grand Progressive tradition of denying an ideological agenda while pursuing it vigorously under the false-flag of reasonableness is alive and well. And he reveals how this dangerous game may lead us further down the path of self-destruction.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nConservative columnist Goldberg (Liberal Fascism) takes on those who, in his view, regurgitate popular nostrums as an alternative to conducting informed discussion. The wide-ranging narrative covers such topics as ideology vs. pragmatism; separation of church and state; the quest for Ã¢â‚¬Å“diversityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; social Darwinism vs. social justice; and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Living Constitution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Though GoldbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious purpose is to hammer liberal rhetoric, he relies on overstatement to clinch his points. Are we actually Ã¢â‚¬Å“almost at the point where we have a constitutional crisis if a kid says Ã¢â‚¬ËœGod bless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to a sneezing public-school teacherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Such hyperbole detracts from the legitimate concerns he raises, such as that sloppy language can lead to sloppy thinking or the easy acceptance of extreme ideas. While commitment to a partisan outlook does not necessarily invalidate the product, the observer of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political whirligig will regard this book as a touch one-sided.\n\nMeet the Author\nJonah GoldbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first book, Liberal Fascism, was a number one New York Times bestseller. He is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the founding editor of National Review Online. He is also a Los Angeles Times columnist, a Fox News contributor, and a member of the board of contributors at USA Today.
