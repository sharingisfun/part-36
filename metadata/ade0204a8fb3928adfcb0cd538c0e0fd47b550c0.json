As the naughty aristocrat, Michelle Ryan is given quite an entrance here, diving like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible into a Fort Knox-style museum to steal a priceless artefact. Evading the police, she meets the Doctor on board a London bus, and as getaway vehicles go, it's unbeatable. A wormhole opens up, transporting the double-decker and its frightened passengers into a world of sand. Planet of the Dead is a giddy mix of the exotic (chirruping fly men with flicky mandibles) and the provincial, the gags are great and the rippling orange dunes look fantastic. For now at least it's as much Doctor Feelgood as Doctor Who - funny, sunny and as British as the flag. Hold very tight, please! \n\nAspect Ratio: 720 x 576 : 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen\n\nVideo: H.264 High Profile : 1000kbps 25fps : 2 Pass Encoded\n\nAudio: AAC-LC 48000Hz 128kbps ABR Stereo\n\nMD5 Checksum: AAD5CFAD565F8707E7D5E0D760C44DA4\n\n[Frank_UK]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade0204a8fb3928adfcb0cd538c0e0fd47b550c0","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Easter+Special+2009+-+Planet+of+The+Dead+%5BBBC+One%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade0204a8fb3928adfcb0cd538c0e0fd47b550c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,224,32,74,143,179,146,138,223,203,12,213,56,192,224,253,71,181,80,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
