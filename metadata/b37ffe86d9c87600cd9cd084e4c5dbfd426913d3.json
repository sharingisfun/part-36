So Fine (2:35)\n\nEach song is quick and energetic, and has a classic 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s folk-rock feel. The harmonizing is spot on, particularly in SearchinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and EverybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Been TalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ where the backups by Cass really shine through, as do the occasional high notes and almost-yelling vocals being hit on the male end. While no song is over three minutes long, the expressive You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Judge a Book by the Cover clocks in at 2:59 and outshines the other eight songs on the album for sheer quality, of writing, singing, and performing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the kind of song that would be released as a single on the radio today to promote a new band, the kind of single fans download on iTunes and listen to over and over.\n\nSurprisingly, the 21-minute length of the album doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappoint, and in fact turns it into a quick and relaxing easy listen that asks to be left on repeat and let to play over and over. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great tribute to music from the 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s (big surprise since it was recorded in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, right?) and though some of the songs sound vaguely familiar - due to the large amount of music of this type made in the time period - each song manages to hold its own with the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ears and stay new.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b37ffe86d9c87600cd9cd084e4c5dbfd426913d3","amp;dn":"The+Mugwumps...The+Mugwumps%281967%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b37ffe86d9c87600cd9cd084e4c5dbfd426913d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,127,254,134,217,200,118,0,205,156,208,132,228,197,219,253,66,105,19,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
