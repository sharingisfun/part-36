The combined effects of climate change, economic collapse, a world-wide pandemic and a devastating earthquake have transformed Vancouver. The population has been decimated; most trees and houses have been burned for fuel; food is self-grown or acquired by barter; there is no modern technology, no law, education, medicine or government; privation is universal.\n\nAn old man called Frost remembers the &quot;good times&quot;. Those who live on his &quot;farm&quot; among collapsed warehouses and the foundations of vanished houses at the edge of the city struggle to maintain human values. But when others in this makeshift world are driven only by greed and the need for power, all values must ultimately be replaced by the simple instinct for survival.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed5f5b1bffc92388dd1e5b6253c7edd38d48c12c","amp;dn":"Since+Tomorrow+by+Morgan+Nyberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed5f5b1bffc92388dd1e5b6253c7edd38d48c12c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,95,91,27,255,201,35,136,221,30,91,98,83,199,237,211,141,72,193,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
