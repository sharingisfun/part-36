In a remarkably accessible, even breezy style, she looks at these issues in light of recent history both abroad and at home, from the religious fundamentalism that led to the ouster of the shah of Iran to the invasion of Iraq and American hope that a political culture can emerge there that integrates democracy and Islam. But Albright also looks critically at President Bush, an evangelical Christian who invokes God in the name of fighting &quot;evil.&quot; In this ambitious, thoughtful, and wide-ranging treatment, Albright deftly balances the pragmatic need to confront religious-based unrest and the idealistic need to temper one&amp;#039;s own personal beliefs in the public realm. While fully acknowledging the threat al- Qaeda poses, Albright rejects the notion that a &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; is in progress and wisely calls for care and nuance in how America approaches international confrontations that are tinged with religion.\n\naudio\naudiobook\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a42da0c10ed86cdf6ca6a8ba9b1ea546c3dc7e","amp;dn":"%5BAudiobook%5D+Madeleine+Albright+-+The+Mighty+and+the+Almighty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a42da0c10ed86cdf6ca6a8ba9b1ea546c3dc7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,164,45,160,193,14,216,108,223,108,166,168,186,155,30,165,70,195,220,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
