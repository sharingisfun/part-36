Puzzling over the document's sinister entries, Jake pieces together a story of mass murder near the Texas-Mexico border two decades before. If Jake's theory is correct, the names listed on the ledger's final page are the victims of a previously unknown serial killer. Leads are scarce until a gruesome new crime scene, deep in the Mexican desert, shows a chilling connection to the border deaths of long ago. \nGenre: Psychological Thriller\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7550efaada92e4a0b1665e634de66d1cefd04d8","amp;dn":"Total+Victim+Theory+-+Ian+Ballard.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7550efaada92e4a0b1665e634de66d1cefd04d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,85,14,250,173,169,46,74,11,22,101,230,52,222,102,209,206,253,4,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
