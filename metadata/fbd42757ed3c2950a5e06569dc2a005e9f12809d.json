Joined by bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne, Rollins is heard at one of his peaks on such pieces as &quot;I'm an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande),&quot; his own &quot;Way out West,&quot; &quot;There Is No Greater Love,&quot; and &quot;Come, Gone&quot; (a fast stomp based on &quot;After You've Gone&quot;). The William Claxton photo of Rollins wearing Western gear (and holding his tenor) in the desert is also a classic.\n\nTracklist\n1 IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m An Old Cowhand\n2 Solitude\n3 Come, Gone\n4 Wagon Wheels\n5 There Is No Greater Love\n6 Way Out West\n\n\nPersonnel\nSonny Rollins (ts)\nRay Brown (b)\nShelly Manne (d) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd42757ed3c2950a5e06569dc2a005e9f12809d","amp;dn":"Sonny+Rollins+Way+Out+West%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd42757ed3c2950a5e06569dc2a005e9f12809d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,212,39,87,237,60,41,80,165,224,101,105,220,42,0,94,159,18,128,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
