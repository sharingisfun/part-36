The best\nof his contemporaries and many subsequent Irish writers have much to\nthank him for.&quot;  Sunday Times\n\n&quot;Flann O'Brien is inventive, his storytelling is swift and sure, making\nthe eccentric seem natural and the commonplace hilarious.&quot;\n\nThe Times\n\n&quot;Even with Ulysses and Finnegans Wake behind him, James Joyce might\nhave been envious.&quot;  Observer\n\n---------------\n\nWhen I first read this book I was completely awestruck and finished it the very same evening unable to put it down. Mindblowingly scary and hilariously absurd at the same time, it points backwards towards masters like Kafka and Orwell, but even more forward to great stylists like Terry Gilliams (and the rest of the pythons) and Phillip K. Dick. A cornerstone in modern literature, and a must read for any fans of the above mentioned.\n\nCrappy un-proofread scan of the book here: http://pastebay.com/82563 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Policeman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Policeman&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flann_O%27Brien","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73f63938b84a8c1603922dc00f4a4c02d03b9bf","amp;dn":"Flann+O%5C%27Brien+-+The+Third+Policeman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73f63938b84a8c1603922dc00f4a4c02d03b9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,63,99,147,139,132,168,193,96,57,34,220,0,244,164,192,45,3,185,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
