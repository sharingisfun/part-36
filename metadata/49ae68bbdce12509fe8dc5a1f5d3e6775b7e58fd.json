Despite a summer of upheaval Saints enjoyed a record-breaking start to this season and are hopeful of extending their three-match unbeaten run against City on home turf. While Saints celebrated an impressive start to the campaign, Tottenham and Everton struggled to get going and are both desperate for three points at White Hart Lane in the day's other match. Saturday's busy Premier League programme - featuring eight games in total - is also reviewed and analysed.\n\n\nThe only 50fps Match of the Day 2 available...
