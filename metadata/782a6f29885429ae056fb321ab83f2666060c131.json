This means that some episodes are M4A, and some are MP3.\n\nAs the original episodes had a variety of naming and tagging schemes over time, the episodes have all been renamed and re-tagged for consistency. This will be beneficial for future listeners who won't have the benefit of a podcast app doing their organizing for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:782a6f29885429ae056fb321ab83f2666060c131","amp;dn":"Enough+-+The+Podcast+%28All+225+Episodes%2C+Renamed+%26amp%3B+ReTagged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"782a6f29885429ae056fb321ab83f2666060c131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,42,111,41,136,84,41,174,5,111,179,33,171,131,242,102,96,96,193,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
