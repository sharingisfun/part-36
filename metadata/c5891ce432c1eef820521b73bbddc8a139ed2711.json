Four of them are available on the Wire soundtrack along with a bunch of rap-type tracks that I have no interest in. I grabbed three of the tracks from the soundtrack then found the longer Tom Waits version on his album - Franks Wild Years and the missing Steve Earle track from his album - Washington Square Serenade.\n\nI put this together for myself but here it is if someone else has a use for it. Please leave a comment if you download and seed at least 1:1. Cheers.\n\n01 The Blind Boys of Alabama - Way Down in the Hole\n\n02 Tom Waits - Way Down in the Hole\n\n03 The Neville Brothers - Way Down in the Hole\n\n04 Domaje - Way Down in the Hole\n\n05 Steve Earle - Way Down in the Hole\n\nCue sheet included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5891ce432c1eef820521b73bbddc8a139ed2711","amp;dn":"Various+-+The+Wire+-+Five+Themes+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5891ce432c1eef820521b73bbddc8a139ed2711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,137,28,228,50,193,238,248,32,82,27,115,187,221,200,161,57,237,39,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
