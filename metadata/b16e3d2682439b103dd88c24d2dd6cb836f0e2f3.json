Seven of those hits were included (the exception being the seasonal &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot;), along with three LP tracks, one each from One of These Nights, Hotel California, and The Long Run. Disdained by longtime fans and by the Eagles themselves, the collection was perfect for listeners who knew the band through number one radio hits like &quot;New Kid in Town,&quot; &quot;Hotel California,&quot; and &quot;Heartache Tonight.&quot; It also spared them having to buy mediocre albums like The Long Run and Eagles Live just to have copies of the best-known songs from those releases. No wonder, then, that over the years Eagles Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 achieved multi-platinum status. \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Hotel california [06:29] \n 02.Heartache tonight [04:24] \n 03.Seven bridges road [02:58] \n 04.Victim of love [04:09] \n 05.The sad cafe [05:32] \n 06.Life in the fast lane [04:45] \n 07.I can't tell you why [04:54] \n 08.New kid in town [05:04] \n 09.The long run [03:41] \n 10.After the thrill is gone [04:41] \n ____ \n \n 46:37 min \n 68,6 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b16e3d2682439b103dd88c24d2dd6cb836f0e2f3","amp;dn":"The_Eagles-Greatest_Hits_Vol2-%28Retail%29-1982-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b16e3d2682439b103dd88c24d2dd6cb836f0e2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,110,61,38,130,67,155,16,61,216,140,36,210,221,108,184,54,240,226,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
