This eye-opening and disturbing film tackles the complexity behind this seeming paradox, placing the voices of critics, producers, and performers alongside the observations of men and women as they candidly discuss the role pornography has played in shaping their sexual imaginations and relationships. Honest and non-judgmental, The Price of Pleasure moves beyond the liberal versus conservative debates so common in the culture to paint a myth-busting and nuanced portrait of how pleasure and pain, commerce and power, liberty and responsibility have become intertwined in the most intimate area of our lives. An ideal tool for initiating classroom discussion about this notoriously difficult subject.\n\nDVD contains two version: an unexpurgated version (including explicit &quot;hardcore&quot; pornographic images) and a special &quot;blurred&quot; version edited for the classroom. DVD extras include an interview with Noam Chomsky about how and why he accepted an interview with Hustler magazine in 2004, and his candid view on pornography.\n\nViewer discretion advised: contains violence, nudity, and sexual imagery.\n\nSections: Introduction | Porn Stars: Myths &amp; Realities | Just a Fantasy? | Empowered by Porn? | Harder and Harder... | DVD Extra: An interview with Noam Chomsky","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de7b7efdddd6721c9614d5bb85019e3738fe5411","amp;dn":"The+Price+of+Pleasure%3A+Pornography%2C+Sexuality+%26+Relationships+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de7b7efdddd6721c9614d5bb85019e3738fe5411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,123,126,253,221,214,114,28,150,20,213,187,133,1,158,55,56,254,84,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
