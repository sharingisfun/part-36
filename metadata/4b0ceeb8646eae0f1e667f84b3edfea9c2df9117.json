Rogers. It was written by Ralph Macchio, illustrated by Frank Cirocco and published by epic Comics in 1991.\n\nWikipedia sets the scene:\n\nSamurai Cat (aka Miaowara Tomokato) is the main character in a series of books by Mark Rogers. To accompany the anachronistic satire, almost every page in each book has a picture painted by Rogers, depicting the events described on that page. Each chapter is a bizarre parody of some historical or pop culture event, but the event is always treated as an entirely serious one. For example, no one finds it at all unusual that Tomokato is an upright, talking, sword-wielding cat.\n\nThanks to the creative teams, Mr. Rogers and the scanners. Get it, pay it forward.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b0ceeb8646eae0f1e667f84b3edfea9c2df9117","amp;dn":"Samurai+Cat+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b0ceeb8646eae0f1e667f84b3edfea9c2df9117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,12,238,184,100,110,174,15,30,102,127,132,179,237,254,169,194,223,145,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
