It does nothing on its own.\n\n\nUndelete for Android is an application for root users that allows you to recover any type of deleted file from your SD card or internal storage.\n\nWith support for over 1000 file types, Undelete can come in handy if you accidentally delete photos or want some old tunes to listen to on the go.\n\nUndelete can also securely wipe and shred files so that they will be impossible for others to recover.\n\nFeatures:\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Restore any file that has not been written over\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Securely wipe/shred files\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Works with documents, images, video, music, archives and binaries\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Thumbnail preview generation\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Batch operations\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Custom restore folder\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Preview media files\n\nWithout the unlock Key, this application will only restore image files. Please buy the Key to unlock full functionality.\n\nCurrently, only FAT is supported. On most devices this means that only the external SD is supported.\n\nSome files that are discovered after a scan may fail to recover as the data can be corrupted beyond repair, just like desktop based solutions.\n\nROOT PERMISSIONS require that you modify the operating system on your device, visit our website for more information: http://fahrbot.co.uk/root\n\nINTERNET and READ DATA permissions are needed for the logging system. Logs are only sent manually with your permission through the &quot;Write to us&quot; dialog.\n\nWhat's in this version:2.1.3.6\nIncreased compatibility with JellyBean\nFixed issues from user replies\n2.1.3.5\nFixed JellyBean issues\nFixed issues from user replies\n2.1.3.4\nReworked license checking\nFixed some bugs from user replies\n2.1.3.3\nFixed SD card discovery issue\nFixed thumbnail generation issues\nFixed preview generation bug\n2.1.3.2\nFixed shred functionality\nImproved recovery on ICS\n\nMore Info:\nCode:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fahrbot.apps.undelete.key&amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fahrbot.apps.undelete.key&amp;hl=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDownload and seed ! - ARMANI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5981c93814ed642d8159d051d0484b115b5d7b","amp;dn":"Undelete+Key+1.0++-+ARMANI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5981c93814ed642d8159d051d0484b115b5d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,89,129,201,56,20,237,100,45,129,89,208,81,208,72,75,17,91,93,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
