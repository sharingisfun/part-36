At the time, critics complained that Mehndi's music was only popular due to his videos that featured beautiful women dancing. Mehndi's response was to create a video that featured only himself. The song was a success, with the unexpected benefit of becoming a cult hit in other countries. The song has also become an internet meme, inspiring numerous online parodies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355ad005ee4f9587c4a36fc52790279b5ecef58d","amp;dn":"Daler+Mehndi+-+Tunak+Tunak+Tun.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355ad005ee4f9587c4a36fc52790279b5ecef58d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,90,208,5,238,79,149,135,196,163,111,197,39,144,39,155,94,206,245,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
