Europe is collapsing in on itself. Around the world, people are consumed by fear and anger, and one question is on everyone's lips: Is the financial crisis over, or are we headed towards economic disaster? End of the Road is a documentary that chronicles the global financial collapse. Told in an entertaining and easy to follow style, the film tells the story of how the world came to be in such a state, from the seeds sown after WW2, to the current troubles facing us today, and to the possible future that may await us all. Some of the world's top economic minds share the hidden tale behind the mishandling of the world's finances, give insight into how bad policy and a flawed monetary system joined together to create a catastrophe, as well as sharing their own personal advice on how the average person can best prepare for their financial future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a14cec57fbd4defadc1a58abecba91445eeea51","amp;dn":"END+of+the+ROAD+How+Money+Became+Worthless+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a14cec57fbd4defadc1a58abecba91445eeea51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,20,206,197,127,189,77,239,173,193,165,138,190,203,169,20,69,238,234,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
