Cherokee has had several recognized dialects in the past. The two main dialects are the North Carolina, spoken on the Qualla (ÃƒÂ¡Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â½Ã‚Â³) reservation by about 3,000 persons. and the Oklahoma, or Western, which is a concensus of the different ways of speech among the Cherokees mingled there after their removal from the East in the 1830s. This book uses the Oklahoma dialect.\n\n\nThere also exists a 3 cd-set that has the authors give correct pronunciation for all the words taught int he book.\n\n\nThe following PDF contains the first 65 pages of the text and covers *alot* of material. It is strongly recommended that you find a practice partner. If you want to type in the native syllabary, you will need to install the two &quot;Aboriginal&quot; (Serif and Sans) fonts available online at no charge. (Just Google it!) You will also need to install a keyboard driver, for M$, get keyman, you want the one that does multi-key conversion to single glyphs. If you are using Ubuntu or other Linux variant, see the thread referenced below on how to setup .XCompose so that you can type it *easily*.\n\nÃƒÂ¡Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¡Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â€žÂ¢!\n\n***** Cherokee Lessons w/MP3 audio &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5638842/Cherokee_Language_Lessons_Revision_2.10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5638842/Cherokee_Language_Lessons_Revision_2.10&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***** Cherokee Bingo Animals I &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4989132/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4989132/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***** The Cherokee Bingo Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://games.vbservices.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://games.vbservices.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n******* Easy to type ÃƒÂ¡Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â½Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â½Ã‚Â© under Ubuntu Linux, etc*** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.linuxforums.org/forum/misc/130701-xmodmap-creating-cherokee-keyboard-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.linuxforums.org/forum/misc/130701-xmodmap-creating-cherokee-keyboard-2.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0e72d54359b5ba3f83ddee3bae4b5c476ccebb0","amp;dn":"Beginning+Cherokee+%28%C3%A1%C2%8F%C2%A3%C3%A1%C5%BD%C2%B3%C3%A1%C5%BD%C2%A9%2FTsalagi%29+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0e72d54359b5ba3f83ddee3bae4b5c476ccebb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,231,45,84,53,155,91,163,248,61,222,227,186,228,181,196,118,204,235,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
