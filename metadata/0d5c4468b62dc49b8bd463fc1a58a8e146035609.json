In China, Deng Xiao Ping opened up the country to foreign capitalists; in Britain and America, the free market revolution was unleashed by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The Party's Over compares the lives of workers in a Chinese company with their co-workers in Britain.\n\nRobert Peston interviews bankers, politicians and economists, and concludes that the boom we enjoyed before the crash was based on an illusion, and that the world's economy is now so unbalanced that in the West we face a sobering wake-up call.\n\n\nAVC 1080 to XviD 2pass 720*400\nAC3 stream copy 192Kbps/2ch \n\nEnjoy, \nPls help seed! \n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5c4468b62dc49b8bd463fc1a58a8e146035609","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Party%5C%27s+Over_+How+the+West+Went+Bust+1+of+2+XviD+AC3.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5c4468b62dc49b8bd463fc1a58a8e146035609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,92,68,104,182,45,196,155,139,212,99,252,26,88,168,225,70,3,86,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
