O. Shklyarsky,  N. N. Chentsov and I. M. Yaglom. \n\n  This book contains the conditions of problems, the answers and hints\n  to them and ihe solutions of the problems. The conditions of the\n  most difficult problems are marked by stars. \n\n  Most of the problems in the book are independent of one another\n  except those in the last hvo sections (&quot;Complex Numbers&quot; and\n  &quot;Several Problems in Number Theory&quot;) where the problems are more\n  closely interrelated. \n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by V. M. Volosov and\n  I. G. Volosova. The book was published by first Mir Publishers in\n  1978.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  PDF | 15.3 MB | Pages: 432 | Bookmarked | OCR\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface 5 \nInstructions 8 \nProblems 9 \n1.
