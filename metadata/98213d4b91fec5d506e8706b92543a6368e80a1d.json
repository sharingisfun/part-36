Suzanne Bancroft is a single nurse at a small Colorado hospital, her life is tight knit, friends are few and her craving for adventure is all but nonexistent.\n\nHowever she will soon hold the key to both heaven and hell in the palm of her trembling unsure hands...yet will she accept it?\n\nYou see, Suzanne Bancroft is going to die, and the end of the world will be her fault. A relentless demi-god has declared he will murder Suzanne and her death will begin a chain of events culminating in Ragnarok. Worse yet, her murderer can see her fate! While still trying to understand her new role as the Valkyrie, Suzanne must seek the true nature of fate and ask herself a hard question: how do you fight a battle you're destined to lose?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98213d4b91fec5d506e8706b92543a6368e80a1d","amp;dn":"Power+Of+The+Valkyrie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98213d4b91fec5d506e8706b92543a6368e80a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,33,61,75,145,254,197,213,6,232,112,107,146,84,58,99,104,232,10,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
