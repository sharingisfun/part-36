And for all cooks who love to get together for coffee and a little something, dozens and dozens of desserts: pies, cakes, cookies, bars, and a multitude of cheesecakes; Rugelach and Hamantaschen, Mandelbrot and Sufganyot (Hanukkah jelly doughnuts). Not to mention Tanta Esther GittelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HusbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Second Wife LenaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nut Cake.\n\nBlending the recipes with over 160 stories from the Rabinowitz familyÃ¢â‚¬â€by the end of the book you'll have gotten to know the whole wacky clanÃ¢â‚¬â€and illustrated throughout with more than 500 photographs reaching back to the 19th century, Cooking Jewish invites the reader not just into the kitchen, but into a vibrant world of family and friends. Written and recipe-tested by Judy Bart Kancigor, a food journalist with the Orange County Register, who self-published her first family cookbook as a gift and then went on to sell 11,000 copies, here are 532 recipes from her extended family of outstanding cooks, including the best chicken soup ever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ really! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from her mother, Lillian. (Or as the author says, &quot;When you write your cookbook, you can say your mother's is the best.&quot;)\n\nEvery recipe, a joy in the belly.
