There is something that will be benefiting humankind for generations to come!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n- Tom Bearden\n=============================================\nJust attempting to think about the notion of Nicola Tesla being able to shuttle energy at will around a single wire circuit causes most people to claim that such concepts are far beyond their comprehension.\n\nAfter all, don't we need two wires, just for a start?\n\nWell, it turns out that the problem is that existing electrical technology just does not have an adequate vocabulary to describe what the Great Man was doing.\n\nIn this film, John Bedini meticulously teaches us the missing technology on the blackboard, while demonstrating it on the bench........AND adapting it to charge batteries, something no-one has ever done before.\n\nThe DVD is a must for anyone seeking not only an understanding of our missing electrical science, but also for those seeking to put it to practical use.\n=============================================\nlink: energyfromthevacuum_com\n=============================================\n\n      Format : MPEG-4\n      File size : 331 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 516 Kbps\n      Codec : H.264\n      Codec/Info : H.264 (3GPP)\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 349 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\nAudio:\n      Codec : AAC LC\n      Codec/Info : AAC Low Complexity\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 165 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 106 MiB\n      Encoded date : UTC 2009-01-02 14:19:46\n      Tagged date : UTC 2009-01-02 16:18:42\n=============================================\n\nPlease SEED!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f854e550bb644b4f00a164cfd2e52cb319572457","amp;dn":"Energy+from+the+Vacuum+PART+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f854e550bb644b4f00a164cfd2e52cb319572457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,84,229,80,187,100,75,79,0,161,100,207,210,229,44,179,25,87,36,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
