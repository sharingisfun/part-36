However, you can overcome those limitations through the use of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. In this workshop from digital imaging guru Tim Grey, learn both how to capture HDR images and how to organize, assemble, and optimize them after the fact, whether you prefer to use HDR Pro, Nik HDR Efex Pro, or Photomatix.\nTopics include:\n\n    Capturing, reviewing, and organizing HDR images\n    Maximizing detail in a single image\n    Simple single-image HDR\n    Assembling from Bridge or Lightroom\n    Choosing a conversion mode\n    Using presets\n    HDR Pro adjustment options\n    Using Nik HDR Efex Pro\n    Using Photomatix\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fce653766b63a5c360241be6e4ace5aad52457ab","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Getting+Started+with+HDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fce653766b63a5c360241be6e4ace5aad52457ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,230,83,118,107,99,165,195,96,36,27,230,228,172,229,170,213,36,87,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
