Grab it while you can!! Quality is reasonable given the shows are almost fifty years old. I will eventually be uploading Season Three as well, but not Season One, as I don't have it. Please have patience - my connection speed is slow.\n\nMany kids in the 1960s and 1970s grew up watching the adventures of the Junior Rangers and their friends Joe Two Rivers, Chief Forest Ranger Keeley and RCMP Sergeant Scott. Great bit of nostalgia for those who remember, and still very watchable today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b36ea28c1dae154644be929112844ec7ea15e17e","amp;dn":"The+Forest+Rangers+-+Season+Two+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b36ea28c1dae154644be929112844ec7ea15e17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,110,162,140,29,174,21,70,68,190,146,145,18,132,78,199,234,21,225,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
