Jitters in the second round cause one chef to drop something on the floor: Will she be able to pull herself together to put together a decent entree? In the final round, the last two chefs are in a hurry to make curry desserts that the judges will love, but one chef runs into serious trouble in the final seconds.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 30-Apr-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d99509a24fcefe4957e5cf7c434e7b00ce0c76c1","amp;dn":"Chopped.S15E04.Without.Missing.a.Beet.HDTV.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d99509a24fcefe4957e5cf7c434e7b00ce0c76c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,149,9,162,79,206,254,73,87,229,207,124,67,78,123,0,206,12,118,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
