He was hailed as a hero, but little is known about this mysterious and charismatic man after those events. Here is Lawrence's life after Arabia, his service in the RAF and the Tank Corps as a mere ranker, and how he became an expert in the technology of the new RAF. The book examines the work he did for the 1929 Schneider Trophy Race, the development of its armour plated offspring, the Armoured Target Boat. It also investigates his literary endeavours and his tragically early death, a sad end to a Renaissance man of all talents, an academic, a talented engineer and a soldier sans pareil.\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b5c2cba5ab78ef639ce44813cfc8e90a0c60593","amp;dn":"Andrew_R_B_Simpson_-_Another_Life.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b5c2cba5ab78ef639ce44813cfc8e90a0c60593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,92,44,186,90,183,142,246,57,206,68,129,60,252,142,144,160,198,5,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
