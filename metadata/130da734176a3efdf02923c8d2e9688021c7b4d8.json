If you're like most of us, you can probably name the processor (Intel or AMD, Celeron or Pentium), maybe how much RAM it has, and maybe how big the hard drive is.\nWhen you go to a computer store and see all the bright shiny PCs laid out next to each other, most will have tags or stickers indicating the:\nProcessor brand and model\nHard drive size and speed\nAmount of memory (RAM)\nGraphics card\nOperating system\nTwo or three years later, when it comes time to upgrade your computer, that tag or sticker may be long gone. Speccy was designed as a free electronic &quot;what's inside&quot; sticker for your PC.\nIsn't this information in Windows?\nYes and no. Some of the basic information can be found by right-clicking My Computer and then clicking Properties. The General tab lists some statistics, and the Device Manager on the Hardware tab lists all of the hardware you've got installed. But it misses out lots of information that you need.\nSpeccy will give you detailed statistics on every piece of hardware in your computer. Including CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Graphics Cards, Hard Disks, Optical Drives, Audio support. Additionally Speccy adds the temperatures of your different components, so you can easily see if there's a problem!\nWhy do I need Speccy?\nAt first glance, Speccy may seem like an application for system administrators and power users. It certainly is, but Speccy can also help normal users, in everyday computing life.\nIf you need to add more memory to your system, for example, you can check how many memory slots your computer has and what memory's already installed. Then you can go out and buy the right type of memory to add on or replace what you've already got.\nIf you're going to be selling your PC, you can use Speccy to quickly list out the components. Or, if you're buying a PC, you can use Speccy to check that the computer has what the label says it has.\nAlso, Speccy comes in handy for support. If you're on the phone with technical support and they want to know what video card you have installed, there's no need to hunt around Windows. Speccy has all the information on one easy-to-understand screen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130da734176a3efdf02923c8d2e9688021c7b4d8","amp;dn":"Windows+hardware+information+and+diagnostic+tools.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130da734176a3efdf02923c8d2e9688021c7b4d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,13,167,52,23,106,62,253,240,41,35,200,210,233,104,128,33,199,180,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
