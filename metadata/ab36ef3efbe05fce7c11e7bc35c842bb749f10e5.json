I make your perfect match, your best friend, your true love. I make them alluring, breathtaking, hard as hell to resist. All the data that goes into a human being, memories, genetics, biochemistry, I collect and process that information. I put it together, mix and match to taste, and spit out the person you're going to fall in love with.\n\nThey're 100% real, and 100% virtual. \n\nBut is that enough? Where's the spark? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the thing that makes love true?\n\n---\n\nMatchmaker is a short story set fifteen minutes into the future where the rich buy online people to call their own.\n\nWritten by James L. Wilber, game designer, podcaster, and author of My Babylon, the serial novel about the occult and dark desires.
