Dr. Thompson has pioneered the use of music and sound to help patients reconnect with their own natural source of physical and emotional healing.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is a particular state of consciousness where your body is most conducive to revitalization, emotional balance, and inner peace. While in this state, your metabolism slows down, your mind becomes calm, and your innate resources for healing are at their peak. Brain-mapping research and my experience with patients over many years has shown that this recuperative stateÃ¢â‚¬â€the healing mind stateÃ¢â‚¬â€is associated with a very specific pattern of brainwave activity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Dr. Jeffrey Thompson\n\nThe Healing Mind System CDs work by blending inaudible pulses of sound that mirror the brainwave pattern of the healing mind state into a soothing musical soundtrack. As you listen, your own brainwaves begin to reflect this same powerful brainwave pattern, drawing you easily into this restorative state.\n\nCD 1: Healing Mind System\nHealing the body by listening while exercising, doing yoga, reading, or just going about your daily activities. This peaceful soundtrack will help lead you to a place of relaxation and physical recuperation.\n\nCD 2: Healing Mind System 2.0\nBalancing the emotions by simply playing this audio program in the background, or listen more attentively while practicing the visualization and meditation techniques included in the enclosed booklet.\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rips and all tracks AccurateRip verified.
