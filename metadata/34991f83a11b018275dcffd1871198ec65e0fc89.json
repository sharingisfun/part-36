The music contained on Loving On The Flip Side is too damn good to be anonymously relaunched, decades after musical visionaries blended the best of heavy funk and sweet soul into a unified whole. Thus, Loving On The Flip Side again offers the enthused a chance to listen to, read about and reflect on another great burst of black American creativity: the creation of the sublime genre we like to call Ã¢â‚¬Å“sweet funk.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n01 Darling Dears - I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Ever 3:50\n02 Eddie Finley and The Cincinnati Show Band - Treat Me Right Or Leave Me Alone 3:28\n03 Thomas East - Slipping Around (Full Version) 4:08\n04 Hot Chocolate - We Had True Love (LP Version) 6:16\n05 Little Janice - Since YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Been Gone 2:24\n06 The Equatics - Merry Go Round 2:50\n07 Black Conspirators - Love 3:20\n08 Jazzie Cazzie and the Eight Sounds - Young Girl 4:02\n09 Rhythm Machine - Whatcha Gonna Do? 3:29\n10 Ed Nelson - IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Give You A Ring (When I Come, If I Come) 3:14\n11 Darling Dears - And I Love You 3:35\n12 Symphonic IV - Who Do You Think YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Fooling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Parts I 3:00\n13 Lee Bonds - IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Find A True Love 2:53\n14 Black Exotics - What Am I Waiting For 3:24\n15 Black Velvet - Is It Me You Really Love 3:23\n16 The Conspiracy - I Believe (Our Love Has Gone Away) 4:01\n17 Primitive - You Are Everything To Me 3.45\n18 Eunice Collins - At The Hotel 3:31\n19 Hunts Determination Band - Are We Through 2:49\n20 Disciples of Soul - Together 2:55\n21 Symphonic IV - Who Do You Think YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Fooling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Part II 3:00\n\nI've also included a PDF of the book that comes with this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34991f83a11b018275dcffd1871198ec65e0fc89","amp;dn":"VA+-+Loving+On+The+Flip+Side+-+Sweet+Funk+And+Beat-Heavy+Ballads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34991f83a11b018275dcffd1871198ec65e0fc89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,153,31,131,161,27,1,130,117,220,255,209,135,17,152,236,101,224,252,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
