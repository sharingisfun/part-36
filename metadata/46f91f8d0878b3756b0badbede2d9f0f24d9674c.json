He is interested in research on a certain force field discovered to exist around each of us.  It is not understood what this force field represents and the significance of how its strength differs from person to person.  He observes that at its theoretical maximum value of 977 certain phenomena arise inconsistent with common reality.  He also observes how personal agenda takes precedence over continuity of the research.  For some of us viewers what this force field represents is apparent and that at 977 events lying outside our current understanding of physics should be no surprise. \n\nRussian actress Ekaterina Golubeva (1966 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2011) in the role as assistant to the director of research was once married to Lithuanian art film director Sharunas Bartas and was later a partner of French film director Leos Carax, who has a minor role in this film.  Film director Nikolai Khomeriki graduated from highly rated film school La Femis in France and 977 was his first film.  This is a serious art film and as such does not have a terribly large audience.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f91f8d0878b3756b0badbede2d9f0f24d9674c","amp;dn":"977+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f91f8d0878b3756b0badbede2d9f0f24d9674c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,249,31,141,8,120,179,117,107,11,173,190,222,45,159,15,36,217,103,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
