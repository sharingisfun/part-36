As friends and family gather to watch Geraldine on television, family secrets come to surface and a physical fight occurs, bringing all the family and friends outdoors. As the fight is happening, Geraldine calls them for help with a question during the gameshow. After the question is asked, the scene turns back to the home where the fight is happening outdoors and where only Geraldine's elderly mother, who has less that her full faculties, is left alone, inside near the phone. The telephone rings and rings and rings, until finally she answers. Geraldine, realizing the senility of the woman, doesn't know whether to trust her answer. Geraldine and her husband return to announce whether she answered the question correctly or not, only to discover long buried family truths have come to light.\n\n\nJane Curtin ... as Geraldine Liddle\nMary Walsh ... as Rose\nSheila McCarthy ... as Tina\nMatt Frewer ... as Cameron Geary\nPeter MacNeill ... as Henry Liddle\nMonique Mercure ... as Olive Larose\nMarina Orsini ... as Cilla\nPascale Montpetit ... as Diede Murphy\nPatrick McKenna ... as Louie Owen\nJennifer Morehouse ... as Greta Jones\nNicole Maillet ... as Linda Liddle\nTori Mitchell ... as Luara Larose\nDylan Smith ... as Josh Fisher ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e12b5e2e623537e7e902ef7e34238de07a526635","amp;dn":"Geraldine%27s+Fortune+2004+Sat+Rip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e12b5e2e623537e7e902ef7e34238de07a526635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,43,94,46,98,53,55,231,233,2,239,126,52,35,141,224,122,82,102,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
