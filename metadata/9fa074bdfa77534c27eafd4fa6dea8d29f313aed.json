No artwork available alas.\n\n\nYellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) is an influential Japanese electropop band formed in 1978, and renowned as a major influence in popular music and for pioneering the electropop music genre. The principal members are Haruomi Hosono (bass), Yukihiro Takahashi (drums and vocals) and Ryuichi Sakamoto (keyboards).\n\n\n\nYMO - Technodelic Label: Epic \nCatalog#: 513450 2 \nFormat: CD, Album, Reissue, Remastered\nCountry: Europe \nReleased: 2004 / 2007\nGenre: Electronic \nStyle: Experimental \nCredits: Engineer [Assistant] - Yoshifumi Iio \nInstruments - Haruomi Hosono , Ryuichi Sakamoto , Yukihiro Takahashi \nLyrics By - Haruomi Hosono (tracks: 7, , Peter Barakan (tracks: 1, 3, 4, 7, , Ryuichi Sakamoto (tracks: 4) , YMO* (tracks: 2, 6) , Yukihiro Takahashi (tracks: 1, 3) \nLyrics By [Lyrics Anclicised By] - Peter Barakan \nMastered By - Hiroshi Yuasa \nMixed By, Engineer, Mastered By [Remastering], Edited By - Mitsuo Koike \nMusic By - Haruomi Hosono (tracks: 7, , Ryuichi Sakamoto (tracks: 4, 5, 9, 10) , YMO* (tracks: 2, 6) , Yukihiro Takahashi (tracks: 1, 3 to 5, \nOther [Technical Assistance] - Hideki Matsutake \nProducer - H Hosono* \nProducer, Mixed By, Arranged By - YMO* \nNotes: Catalogue number on rear is EPC 513450 2. \nUPC: 5099751345022. \nMade in Austria. \nImprinted SACEM BIEM.\n\n\nTechnodelic is the fourth studio album by Yellow Magic Orchestra. The album is notable for its heavy use of samplers which were not commonly used until the mid to late 80's, resulting in a more minimalist and experimental sound compared to their previous work.\n\nMost of the sampling was made with an LMD-649 - a hand-made sampler developed by Toshiba-EMI engineer Kenji Murata, and a much cheaper alternative to the Linn LM-1 drum machine and Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer available at the time. Notable samples used include Indonesian kecak chanting (Neue Tanz), gamelan and short looped vocals (&quot;paa&quot;, &quot;fuku&quot;, &quot;chiki&quot;) for percussion in Seoul Music, and the final two tracks feature factory noises. The album also features use of speech through a two-way radio, a prepared piano, Prophet-5 synthesizers and a TR-808 drum machine. In another departure from previous albums, Haruomi Hosono has a more prominent role playing the bass guitar as opposed to playing bass lines on synthesizers (this trend appears again on the album Service).\n\nAs with many of YMO's releases, song titles are printed in both Japanese and English. For &quot;Seoul Music&quot;, the kanji &quot;ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚ÂºÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¥Ã…Â¸Ã…Â½&quot; are used, referring to Gyeongseong (ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â±; known as Keijou in Japan), the name of Seoul when Korea was under Japanese rule. &quot;ÃƒÂ§Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¯&quot; simply translates to &quot;Light&quot;. &quot;Neue Tanz&quot; is German for &quot;New Dance&quot;, while &quot;TaisÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½&quot; is Japanese for &quot;gymnastics&quot; or &quot;calesthenics&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;Pure Jam&quot; (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â ; &quot;Jam&quot;) Yukihiro Takahashi/Peter Barakan 4:30 \n2. &quot;Neue Tanz&quot; (ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â°ÃƒÂ¨Ã‹â€ Ã…Â¾ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â¸Ã…Â ; &quot;Shin buyou&quot;) Yellow Magic Orchestra 4:58 \n3. &quot;Stairs&quot; (ÃƒÂ©Ã…Â¡Ã…Â½ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â®Ã‚Âµ; &quot;Kaidan&quot;) Takahashi/Barakan 4:14 \n4. &quot;Seoul Music&quot; (ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚ÂºÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¥Ã…Â¸Ã…Â½ÃƒÂ©Ã…Â¸Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â¥Ã‚Â½; &quot;Keijou ongaku&quot;) Ryuichi Sakamoto/Takahashi/Barakan 4:46 \n5. &quot;Light in Darkness&quot; (ÃƒÂ§Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¯; &quot;Tomoshibi&quot;) Takahashi/Sakamoto 3:40 \n6. &quot;Taiso&quot; (ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã‚ï¿½; &quot;TaisÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½&quot;) Yellow Magic Orchestra 4:21 \n7. &quot;Gradated Grey&quot; (ÃƒÂ§Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ¨Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â²ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â®ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â®Ã‚ÂµÃƒÂ©Ã…Â¡Ã…Â½; &quot;Grey no dankai&quot;) Haruomi Hosono/Barakan 5:33 \n8. &quot;Key&quot; (ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â½Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã…Â ; &quot;Tegakari&quot;) Hosono/Takahashi/Barakan 4:32 \n9. &quot;Prologue&quot; (ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¥Ã‚ï¿½; &quot;Zensou&quot;) Sakamoto 2:31 \n10. &quot;Epilogue&quot; (ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¾Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¥Ã‚ï¿½; &quot;Kousou&quot;) Sakamoto 4:21 \n\n\nPersonnel\nRyuichi Sakamoto: keyboards, vocals \nYukihiro Takahashi: drums, vocals \nHaruomi Hosono: Bass, keyboards, vocals \nPeter Barakan: Lyrics (also radio voice in Pure Jam) \nHideki Matsutake: Technical assistance \n\n\n\nThanks for seeding !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa074bdfa77534c27eafd4fa6dea8d29f313aed","amp;dn":"Yellow+Magic+%5B1981%5D+Technodelic+%28remastered%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa074bdfa77534c27eafd4fa6dea8d29f313aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,160,116,189,250,119,83,76,39,234,253,79,166,222,168,210,159,49,58,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
