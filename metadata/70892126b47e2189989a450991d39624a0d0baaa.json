Now in a potpourri of real tales by turns poignant and laugh-out-loud funny, Cheryl talks about family and growing up, love and loss. With self-deprecating humor and compassionate insight, she remembers the time she hit her baby sister in the head with a rock, how her father taught her to swim by throwing her into deep water, and the day when-while weighing in at 300 pounds-she became an inspirational goddess at her local gym. Filled with universal stories about a daughter's love for her parents and the eternal quest for finding meaning in it all, this book reveals many seemingly unremarkable moments that make a life-the weighty events that, like fat girls sitting on lawn chairs, just won't let go.\n\n\n\n\n0802195609031938","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70892126b47e2189989a450991d39624a0d0baaa","amp;dn":"Fat+Girls+and+Lawn+Chairs+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70892126b47e2189989a450991d39624a0d0baaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,137,33,38,180,126,33,137,152,154,69,9,145,211,150,36,160,208,186,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
