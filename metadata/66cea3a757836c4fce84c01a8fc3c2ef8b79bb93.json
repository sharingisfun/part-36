He brings up issues that mainstream media won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t even touch. His works are very serious, there is nothing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;conspiratorial\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; about them, and if you have not yet read or seen anything by him, now is a great opportunity.\n\nPlease help me share, and please read the text file I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve included.\n\n//Luftwaffe\n\nContents:\nDisc 1 - 01 - The silent death of Cambodia [DVDRip.Luftwaffe]\nDisc 1 - 02 - Nicaragua - A nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s right to survive [DVDRip.Luftwaffe]\nDisc 1 - 03 - Burp!
