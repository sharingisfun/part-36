British writers were prominent in shaping the new type of storytelling - one which reflected the experiences of ordinary people, with characters in whom readers could find not only an escape, but a deeper understanding of their own lives.\n\nBut the novel was more than just a reflection of British life. As Sebastian Faulks explains in this engaging literary and social history, it also helped invent the British. By focussing not on writers but on the people they gave us, Faulks not only celebrates the recently neglected act of novelistic creation but shows how the most enduring fictional characters over the centuries have helped map the British psyche - through heroes from Tom Jones to Sherlock Holmes, lovers from Mr Darcy to Lady Chatterley, villains from Fagin to Barbara Covett and snobs from Emma Woodhouse to James Bond.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0147e331b19fabb7e186b1859f57cd519fefc1e9","amp;dn":"Faulks+on+Fiction+-+Sebastian+Faulks+++%28BBC+Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0147e331b19fabb7e186b1859f57cd519fefc1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,71,227,49,177,159,171,183,225,134,177,133,159,87,205,81,159,239,193,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
