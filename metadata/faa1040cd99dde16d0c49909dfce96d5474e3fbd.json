Moreover, this modified crack also removes the black bars on 4:3, 5:4 and 16:10 resolutions, which is a big plus. To put it simple; this is how L.A. Noire should have been in the first place. \n\n\nMake sure though that you have updated your game to the latest version, &quot;Jackfuste&quot; made this fix to work with v1.0.2396. \n\n\nInstructions: \nin this archive you will find 2 folders, 1 for 30FPS with removed black bars, another for 60FPS with removed black bars, each contains crack files for each aspect ratio, pick 1 then copy the contents of it and overwrite the game files. \n\n\n+Included 4:3 , 5:4 , 16:9 , 16:10 , 16:10+fov","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa1040cd99dde16d0c49909dfce96d5474e3fbd","amp;dn":"L.A.Noire.Enable.60FPS.Remove.Blackbars-jackfuste","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa1040cd99dde16d0c49909dfce96d5474e3fbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,161,4,12,217,157,222,22,208,196,153,9,223,206,150,213,71,78,63,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
