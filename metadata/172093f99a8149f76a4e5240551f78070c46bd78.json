He enjoyed success entering the charts with his first national hit, &quot;Icy,&quot; became involved in a quarrel with that song's collaborator, Young Jeezy, and found himself facing murder charges in the Georgia courts. Before his career as a rapper, Gucci Mane, whose birth name is Radric Davis, loved to write poetry when he was in elementary school. He moved to Atlanta from Birmingham, Alabama with his single mother during the fourth grade. Since progressing to rap was a fairly easy step, Gucci Mane had already spent time in a recording studio by the age of 14. The glamour and sense of fashion of rappers like Big Daddy Kane motivated him to put words to music. His locally played debut single, &quot;Black Tee,&quot; earned him a contract with Big Cat Records, and in May 2005 the label released his debut album, Trap House, which stood at the number one spot on Billboard's Heatseekers chart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172093f99a8149f76a4e5240551f78070c46bd78","amp;dn":"Gucci+Mane+-+Everybody+Looking+%282016%29+%5B16.44+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172093f99a8149f76a4e5240551f78070c46bd78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,32,147,249,154,129,73,247,106,78,82,64,85,31,120,7,12,70,189,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
