He was born in Leeds and attended Oxford University where he studied history and performed with the Oxford Revue. He stayed to teach and research medieval history at the university for several years. His collaboration as writer and performer with Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook in the satirical revue Beyond the Fringe at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival brought him instant fame. He gave up academia, and turned to writing full-time, his first stage play Forty Years On being produced in 1968.\n\nBennett's distinctive, expressive voice (which bears a strong Leeds accent) and the sharp humour and evident humanity of his writing have made his readings of his work very popular, especially the autobiographical writings. Bennett's readings of the Winnie the Pooh stories are also widely enjoyed. Many of Bennett's characters are unfortunate and downtrodden. Life has brought them to an impasse or else passed them by. In many cases they have met with disappointment in the realm of sex and intimate relationships, largely through tentativeness and a failure to connect with others.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Smut - Stories\n\n* The Complete Talking Heads\n\n* The Habit of Art - A Play\n\n* The Laying On of Hands - Stories\n\n* The Uncommon Reader\n\n* Writing Home\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bennett&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bennett&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/23/alan-bennett-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/23/alan-bennett-interview&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/9713864/Alan-Bennett-interview-people-shouldnt-think-Im-cosy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/9713864/Alan-Bennett-interview-people-shouldnt-think-Im-cosy.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb13976c0a34e577d3c7b57f01db6987a7c59a1f","amp;dn":"Alan+Bennett+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb13976c0a34e577d3c7b57f01db6987a7c59a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,19,151,108,10,52,229,119,211,199,181,127,1,219,105,135,167,197,154,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
