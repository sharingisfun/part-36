It contains most of what is known about his life, his quarrels and fights. The plunder of caravans and Jews, the women, change of god to worship, the Satanic verses, breaking treaties. It&amp;#039;s all in this original Islamic document, the earliest of the Hadith, and primary source to knowing Muhammad. \n\nThis is prof. Gulliaumes translation of the Arab original, published in 1955. The original Arab version is authored in Bagdad ca. 750 AD, and later reconstructed by Ibn Hisham. Some passages which depict an unflattering image of Muhammad has been removed by Hisham, and has been lost to history, except when quoted by the early Islamic historian Tabari.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5341740436a325d1509aa4df65a68a8453a85997","amp;dn":"Ibn+Ishaq%3A+Life+of+Muhammad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5341740436a325d1509aa4df65a68a8453a85997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,65,116,4,54,163,37,209,80,154,164,223,101,166,138,132,83,168,89,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
