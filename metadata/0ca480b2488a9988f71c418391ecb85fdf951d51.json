I then ripped it into Wav files onto my home pc in WAV format and trimmed all the tracks down to size. The LP was mint and the equipment is a REGA P1 turntable and a GRADO gold cartridge and stylus. I think it turned out wonderful. This album is hard to come by, so I thought I'd share it. I've included both MP3 and Flac formats for those who like the choice! Enjoy, and please help me seed it as long as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca480b2488a9988f71c418391ecb85fdf951d51","amp;dn":"Nick+Gilder+-+Body+Talk+Muzik+-+Flac+%26amp%3B+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca480b2488a9988f71c418391ecb85fdf951d51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,164,128,178,72,138,153,136,247,28,65,131,145,236,184,95,223,149,29,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
