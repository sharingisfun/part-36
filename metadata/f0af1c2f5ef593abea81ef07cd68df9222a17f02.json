Darling, who has a Ph.D. in astronomy, has written several books on extraterrestrial life and cosmology. Although this volume offers a single source for comprehensive space flight information, its added value may be limited, as many libraries likely already own biographical resources (such as Michael CassuttÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Who in Space), spaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“mission histories (such as Tim FurnissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s The History of Space Vehicles), and science and technology references (such as the McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology). In addition, readers will find the cross references lacking. Many entries, such as &quot;MECO,&quot; are entered under their acronym or initials, but there is no cross reference from the fun form, in this case &quot;Main Engine Cut Off&quot;. In addition, entries for scientific terms are often inadequate. For example, &quot;weightlessness&quot; is a mere one paragraph, though one would expect much fuller treatment of such a major aspect of space flight. Despite these flaws, DarlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s is the most current work available on this subject, and the detail it provides on satellite missions is notable. Wherever it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²t duplicate existing references, this book is recommended for large academic and public libraries.
