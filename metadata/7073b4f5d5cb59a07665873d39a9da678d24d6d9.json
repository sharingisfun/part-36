Great, most government workers are getting an unplanned vacation, and people with planned vacations are having them ruined. Remember though, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all for a good causeÃ¢â‚¬â€denying the American people affordable healthcare.\n\nPresident Obama decried the Ã¢â‚¬Å“perpetual cycle of brinksmanship.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nice way of putting it. Ã¢â‚¬Å“BrinksmanshipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means taking things right to the brink before pulling back. These idiots went full speed straight over the brink.\n\nAt the last minute last night, the House Republicans said we need a Ã¢â‚¬Å“conference committeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to sort out their differences with the Senate. Now they want to negotiate! The only time that Republicans show up to negotiate is when they have explosives strapped to their chest. Republicans in Congress have continuously refused to begin budget negotiations for over half a year. Now, with their shutdown upon us, they want to start naming a committee! They drove the car over a cliff, and then they say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to schedule a brake inspection. Does Boehner have an exit plan? All I know is thisÃ¢â‚¬â€if IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on an airplane with John Boehner, I definitely do not want him to be the one sitting in the emergency exit aisle.\n\nThe votes to fund the government are there in the House, but John Boehner wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let a vote take place. Boehner wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move until the Tea Party caucus gives in. We literally waiting until the most delusional segment of our population does the rational thing. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the thing about hostage negotiationsÃ¢â‚¬â€the person who is holding people at gunpoint is rarely the most rational person in the whole affair.\n\nThe beautiful ironyÃ¢â‚¬â€the only thing of beauty in this ugly affairÃ¢â‚¬â€is that the government shutdown over stopping Obamacare has no effect on Obamacare whatsoever. Obamacare is untouched, but the National Parks are closed down! The Tea Party should have just sold this shutdown as a fight to shut down the Statue of LibertyÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what they accomplished.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7073b4f5d5cb59a07665873d39a9da678d24d6d9","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+01+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7073b4f5d5cb59a07665873d39a9da678d24d6d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,115,180,245,213,203,89,160,118,101,135,61,57,169,218,103,141,36,214,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
