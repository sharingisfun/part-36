For ... HTC Touch-Pro ... ONLY ...!!!\n\nBuild 23529 \n\n[ROM][WWE][7-Feb-10] Timolol's stock-like WM6.5 b23529 ROM for Touch Pro\n \n\nThe rationale behind this ROM was to make it clean and stock-like. It was made for the HTC Touch Pro and is my interpretation of what a WM 6.5 ROM would be like if HTC had designed it themselves (minus Manila/TF3D). Only HTC applications (or applications which have been included in official HTC ROMs) have been included in this ROM, and any third-party applications must be installed by the user. No custom themes, icons or fonts have been included in this ROM in keeping with the stock-like philosophy. Everything that you might expect HTC to include in their official ROMs (with the exception of TF3D) has been included, in addition to all standard WM6.5 features. Another goal in this ROM was to keep it as bug-free as possible and thus the absolute latest and usually buggy versions of applications may not be included. I have used the latest bug-free versions of applications.\n\nThis ROM is similar to Da_G's clean ROM, except it is customised for the Touch Pro, and includes more HTC applications than his ROM. These include the HTC Comm Manager, new Tachi HTC Calculator, HTC Album, MP3 Trimmer, Rhodium Power Off Warning, Rhodium Connection Setup plus others. .NetCF 3.5 and Opera Mobile browser are also included in this ROM. This ROM is UC enabled.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a Scandinavian touch pro with the extra keys like (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶)\nyou will need to download Scandinavian KB [v.0.2].zip\n\n\nFor the Swedish keyboard run the program on your phone then choose\nNorwegian/Danish not Swedish. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that this ROM is for a generic HTC Touch Pro and is NOT customised for any particular carrier such as AT&amp;T. The keyboard layout is for the Touch Pro, not the Fuze, and if you are using a Fuze please Follow the link below to find keyboard installation instructions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=528217&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=528217&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b968a8ff211ad1305d9d3bda16a6d8ea3677d5","amp;dn":"Windows+Mobile+6.5+for+HTC+Touch+Pro+%28Build+23529%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b968a8ff211ad1305d9d3bda16a6d8ea3677d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,185,104,168,255,33,26,209,48,93,157,59,218,22,166,216,234,54,119,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
