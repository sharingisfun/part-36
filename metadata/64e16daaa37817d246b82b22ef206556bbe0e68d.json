While investigating the memories of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin working in the North Atlantic during the French and Indian War, they inadvertently trip a hidden memory file that corrupts the Abstergo servers. With the building being put into lockdown, the player is recruited by Melanie Lemay to continue exploring Cormac's memories in an effort to clear the system.\n\nCormac is a new recruit to the Brotherhood of Assassins, working under Achilles Davenport. Achilles sees potential in him, but Cormac develops an insubordinate streak that frustrates his mentors. Believing that taking a more active role in the Brotherhood's affairs will temper his impetuousness, Achilles orders Cormac with his newly acquired ship the MorrÃƒÂ­gan to track down a Templar cell that has been deciphering a Precursor artifact revealing the locations of several Pieces of Eden. The artifact, in the form of a wooden box, had been stolen from the Assassins following a massive earthquake in Haiti some years before. With the help of Benjamin Franklin, a Piece of Eden is located in Lisbon, and Cormac is tasked with retrieving it.\n\nHowever, Cormac has begun questioning the Assassins' motives after seeing their refusal to engage in dialogue with the Templars, and takes no satisfaction from killing an already-dying Templar commander, Lawrence Washington. His doubts come to a head in Lisbon, where his attempt to retrieve the Piece of Eden triggers an earthquake that razes the city. Noting that similar events occurred in Haiti, Cormac is horrified to learn that Achilles and the Assassins intend to pursue the remaining Pieces of Eden. Cormac steals a manuscript necessary to interpret the artifact and flees, while the Assassins give chase. At the edge of the homestead, an Assassin shoots him in the back and leaves him for dead; Shay comes to believe it was his best friend Liam's doing.\n\nCormac is rescued by a passing ship and taken to New York City. Once he recovers, he uses the skills he learned from the Assassins to drive out the city's criminal gangs. His actions attract the attention of George Monro, the city's governor, who offers Cormac the chance to help rebuild the city. Indebted to Monro, Cormac assists the British Army in their early campaigns against the French, and discovers that Achilles' chapter is supporting the French war effort. Monro reveals himself to be a Templar, and despite knowing of Cormac's prior association with the Assassins, offers him a place within their Order. Cormac accepts, and is gradually inducted by the Templar Grandmaster, Haytham Kenway, following Monro's death.\n\nCormac reveals to Kenway that he believes these particular Pieces of Eden are not weapons, but are instead being used to hold the world together, and he pledges to stop the Assassins before they cause another catastrophe. With the help of Captain James Cook, he tracks them through New York, across the Appalachian River Valley and the North Atlantic, killing them one by one. Finally, he chases Achilles and Liam deep into the Arctic Circle, where they find another Precursor temple. Achilles realises that Cormac was right, but Liam accidentally disturbs the Piece of Eden, causing the temple to collapse. While Haytham pursues Achilles, Cormac and Liam fight throughout the temple, with Cormac ultimately killing his former friend. He arrives in time to persuade Haytham to spare Achilles, as his testimony will stop the Assassins from trying to locate other temples. Haytham nonetheless cripples Achilles as a precaution.\n\nWith the Assassin Brotherhood all but destroyed, Cormac is tasked with locating the artifact, and spends the next twenty years searching for it. His search eventually leads him to Versailles, where he discovers it under the care of Charles DorianÃ¢â‚¬â€the father of Arno, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Unity. Cormac kills Charles and takes possession of the artifact, taunting the dying man with the promise that while the American Revolution ended Templar influence in the Americas, a new revolution may yet hold promise.\n\nIn the present day, the player reconciles Cormac's memories. Under the direction of Otso Berg, a senior Templar leader, they upload them to the Assassin network, revealing how close Achilles Davenport came to destroying the world. The result is almost instantaneous, with the Assassins thrown into disarray and, as revealed in Assassin's Creed Unity, retaliating by hacking into the Abstergo's systems and destroying all of the company's Precursor samples as well as causing several of their servers to melt down. As reward for their actions, the player is presented with a choice; join the Templar Order, or die. The game fades to black before a choice is made.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e16daaa37817d246b82b22ef206556bbe0e68d","amp;dn":"3-2-Play+-+Assassins+Creed+Rogue.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e16daaa37817d246b82b22ef206556bbe0e68d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,225,109,170,163,120,23,210,70,184,43,34,239,32,101,86,187,224,230,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
