Upon its release it has quickly ascended into the Ã¢â‚¬Å“must haveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ list of Led Zeppelin shows because of the professional recording and the set list that includes the only 1973 version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Many More TimesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the pristine recording of John Paul JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mellotron symphony before Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thank You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Like the others this has really nice sound and the label did not try to improve it with excessive remastering. They did however eliminate the drum tuning in the introduction before Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock And RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and cut out some tape around the glitches found throughout the show.
