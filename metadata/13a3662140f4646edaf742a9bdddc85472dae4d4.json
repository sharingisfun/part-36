It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike franchise, excluding Neo and Online.\nCounter Strike Global Offensive was released on August 21, 2012, and made available for Microsoft Windows and OS X on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, \nand a US-only version on PlayStation Network. It features classic content, such as revamped versions of classic maps; as well as brand new maps,\n characters and game modes. Cross-platform multiplayer was planned between Windows, OS X and PSN players,\n but was ultimately limited to Windows and OS X because of the differences in update-frequency between systems.\n The PSN version offers three input control methods, which include using either the DualShock 3 controller, PlayStation Move or USB keyboard/mouse.\n \n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]\n\nIn-game screenshot of a Terrorist member (beta version).\nLike the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. \nEach player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. \nThe game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. \nFor most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn. \nPlayers purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. \nCompleting objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. \nIn addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more.\nCounter Strike Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, \nmost notably the firebomb for each side (Molotovs for Terrorists and incendiary grenades for Counter-Terrorists). \nThese temporarily cover a small area in fire, dealing damage to anyone passing through.\n\n[b]GAME MODES:[/b]\n\nCurrently, Global Offensive features five game modes for online play:\nClassic Casual and Competitive: Counter-Strike's most well-known game mode, both involving Defuse and Hostage missions.\nAt the start of each round, players can purchase weapons and gear with money earned from various actions, from assisting on kills to completing objectives. \nFor both mission types, a round ends when either a team completes an objective, or eliminates the other team. \no\t[b]Defuse:[/b] the Terrorists must plant a C4 explosive at one of two designated bombsites; the Counter-Terrorists must prevent the bomb from exploding.\no\t[b]Hostage:[/b] the Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages from the Terrorists, and bring them to an extraction point; the Terrorists must prevent the hostages from escaping. \nIf a Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist attempts to kill hostage, they will suffer a heavy cash penalty. \nAn update later changed how Counter-Terrorists rescue hostages: instead of leading them around, players must carry one hostage at a time to the extraction point.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t[b]Arms Race[/b]: a deathmatch-based mode where each player is rewarded for each kill with a new weapon, with the first player to get a kill with every weapon in a predetermined set winning the game.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t[b]Demolition[/b]: a round-based mode that removes weapon and equipment purchasing, instead rewarding players who manage at least one kill by giving the next weapon in a predetermined set of weapons.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\t[b]Deathmatch[/b] (added on November 12, 2012):[20] a mode consisting of 10-minute matches. \nPlayers must gain the highest possible score by earning kills with different weapons or desired weapons. \nThe number of points from a kill depend on the weapon. Players may also take advantage of bonus timers for different weapons, using them to score extra points. \nLike in Arms Race, players automatically respawn after getting killed, but also when they choose to respawn with bonus weapons.\nGlobal Offensive also offers two offline modes: Offline with Bots, which offers the same game modes with AI-controlled bots; and a Weapons Course for inexperienced and veteran players alike.\n\n[b]ONLINE PLAY:[/b]\n\nGlobal Offensive supports matchmaking and leaderboards for all online game modes, provided by Steam.\nThe provided online service offers the ability to filter by game modes, maps and a built-in Steam friend system. \nValve also employs Valve Anti-Cheat, which can automatically remove and ban players from the Valve online network. \nTo match players of similar skill levels for an enjoyable experience, the game uses an Elo rating system.\nThe PC version of Global Offensive also supports private dedicated servers that the player may connect to through the community server menu in-game. \nThese servers may be heavily modified and can be completely different from the base game.\n\n[b]SETUP &amp; INSTALL STEPS:[/b]\n\n\n[b]INGAME:[/b]\n\n[b][color=red]Warning![/color] You must run as administrator otherwise the Game won't work..[/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a3662140f4646edaf742a9bdddc85472dae4d4","amp;dn":"Counter+Strike+Global+Offensive+eSK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13a3662140f4646edaf742a9bdddc85472dae4d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,163,102,33,64,244,100,110,218,247,66,169,189,221,200,84,114,218,228,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
