This book presents the architecture of a thoroughly and broadly educated human mind as translated into modern software engineering design terms.\n\nThe result is The Autonomous System, based on dynamic logic and the architecture of the human mind. With its human-like intelligence, it is capable of rational thought, reasoning, and an understanding of itself and its tasks.\n\n&quot;A system of thoughts must always have an architectural structure.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Presentation\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 204 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (November 11, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118294246\nISBN-13: 978-1118294246\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de95981cefd04a6d3df661c2dac89ec391508ca2","amp;dn":"The+Autonomous+System%3A+A+Foundational+Synthesis+of+the+Sciences+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de95981cefd04a6d3df661c2dac89ec391508ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,149,152,28,239,208,74,109,61,246,97,194,218,200,158,195,145,80,140,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
