Though Kaguya notes their presence, she pays little to no attention to them on the battlefield and instead opts to attack the real Naruto. As Naruto contemplates his next course of action, he settles on a combination of diversionary tactics and taijutsu. KokuÃ…ï¿½ lends Naruto support with its steam-based ninjutsu bolstering Naruto's physical attacks to monstrous levels. Shocked that she was being pressured in her own dimension, Kaguya emerges from the rubble to find herself surrounded by a barrage of shadow clones. Assaulted from all sides, Kaguya is forced to retreat to another dimension Ã¢â‚¬â€ an opportunity which Naruto and Obito take to invade her dimension.
