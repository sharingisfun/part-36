TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re plagued by recycled stories, stock characters and a clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time for someone to make fun of these games. BIG TIME. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s where ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMark Leung: Revenge of the BitchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ comes in: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fully playable parody RPG. Think of it as an RPG gone wrong. Inspired by Christianity, double rainbows, Kim Jong Il, flaming trolls and Final Fantasy, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevenge of the BitchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features characters and monsters that are bizarre hybrids of public figures and well-known characters. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jhompson, a summonable character inspired by Jack Thompson and Illidan Stormrage, and McFunny, a boss character inspired by the Joker and Ronald McDonald. Recent events such as the subprime mortgage crisis also inspired a bank-themed dungeon and a cleric named Brother Lehman.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3293b6e220e72d613d67cb9512bd481872c4ced","amp;dn":"Mark+Leung%3A+Revenge+of+the+Bitch-GRATiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3293b6e220e72d613d67cb9512bd481872c4ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,41,59,110,34,14,114,214,19,214,124,185,81,43,212,129,135,44,76,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
