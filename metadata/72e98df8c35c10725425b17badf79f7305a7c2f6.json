Most were not in very good shape and required a bit of clean up to make them presentable\n\nAll of the 4-part episodes were put together into single avi files and the 4 single episodes were left independent.\n\nThis listing represents the &quot;supposed&quot; creation order ~ but this is strange given the fact that the &quot;Tricky Trap&quot; single episode was supposedly the sequel to a four-parter later in the same season [From Hopeless To Helpless]. This is, however, the entire 124 episode run.\n\n* ~ a LOT of cleanup work went into this project to even get some of them watchable. So appreciate and Enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72e98df8c35c10725425b17badf79f7305a7c2f6","amp;dn":"Underdog+TV+series+1964-66+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72e98df8c35c10725425b17badf79f7305a7c2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,233,141,248,195,92,16,114,84,37,177,123,173,247,159,115,5,167,194,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
