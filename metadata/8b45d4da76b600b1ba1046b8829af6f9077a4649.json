Most of their song choices are downright humorous (Hot Potato by the Wiggles being a highlight) and some being downright painful (3 Milli Vanilli songs in a row, blech) and 1 15 minute Brian Eno docco to start things off.\n\nI don't know if this is the whole host session, but it's probably the most complete version out there. and ABC's Rage archives don't go back to 95 so I can't check, but please enjoy the next 3 hours!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b45d4da76b600b1ba1046b8829af6f9077a4649","amp;dn":"TISM+Guest+Programming+RAGE+%28VHS%2C+July+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b45d4da76b600b1ba1046b8829af6f9077a4649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,69,212,218,118,182,0,177,186,16,70,184,130,154,246,249,7,122,70,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
