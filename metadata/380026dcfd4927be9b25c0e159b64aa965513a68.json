Its clutter-free, vibrant design and superior visual content position Open among the best looking magazines in the world. Open set out to be original and stimulating, and stays true to that secret covenant with its readers. In some ways, Open is the three magazines rolled into one neat bundle. The first section of the magazine, called Small World, is a zippy 10-12 page selection of the most relevant and interesting news of the week. The middle section has sharp features on politics, sports, entertainment, social trends, health, culture, and much besides. Finally, there's Mindspace, a section consisting of literary essays and length features and tidbits on books and arts, science and gadgets, cinema and celebrity gossip and a freewheeling last page, which in keeping with it spirit, is called Open Space. In its brief existence of five years, Open has already established itself as the sophisticated Indian's magazine of choice. Call Open the return of magazine journalism.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:380026dcfd4927be9b25c0e159b64aa965513a68","amp;dn":"Open+Magazine+-+Culture+Kombat+September+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"380026dcfd4927be9b25c0e159b64aa965513a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,0,38,220,253,73,39,190,155,37,192,225,89,182,74,169,101,81,58,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
