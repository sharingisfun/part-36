Manchester was always great. Here he is at his best.\r\n\r\nThis great time capsule of a book captures the abundant popular history of the United States from 1932 to 1972. It encompasses politics, military history, economics, the arts, science, fashion, fads, social change, sexual mores, communications, graffiti - everything and anything indigenous that can be captured in print.\r\n\r\nMasterfully compressing four crowded decades of our history, The Glory and the Dream relives the epic, significant, or just memorable events that befell the generation of Americans whose lives pivoted between the America before and the America after the Second World War. From the Great Depression through the second inauguration of Richard M. Nixon, Manchester breathes life into this great period of America's growth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e45aae49dd11de72437dd7a103188a851d442e6d","amp;dn":"The+Glory+and+the+Dream+mp3+by+William+Manchester","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e45aae49dd11de72437dd7a103188a851d442e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,90,174,73,221,17,222,114,67,125,215,161,3,24,138,133,29,68,46,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
