While taking photographs of a meteorite shower, she noticed a shooting star seemingly heading toward her. She snapped away as the star came closer. The star fell faster and faster. She gazed up at it frozen. She could not move. Faster and faster the star fell, closer and closer until... silence. For that split second there was nothing. Time stood still. As the star fused with her body, they became one. She fell to the ground, her body sparkling likes the night sky above. She absorbed the power of the star and became Starlex!
