Dobroist Jerry Douglas is added to the line-up and the band includes some more country-rock to the mix, but the most part of the album consists of classics by Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs.\n\nLine-up:\nTony Rice, guitar and lead vocal\nJ. D. Crowe, banjo and baritone vocal\nDoyle Lawson, mandolin and tenor vocal\nBobby Hicks, fiddle\nJerry Douglas, dobro\nTodd Phillips, bass\n\n(from liner notes)\n&quot;What began as a collection of Bluegrass all-stars playing some of their favorite old songs now sounds even more like a band, a true and fine working group whose members know, aticipate and appreciate each other's moves. They play and sing the songs with care and devotion, and, most important of all, with the kind of fire and drive that all great Bluegrass bands must have . . . there is freshness, power and a terrifying beauty here.&quot; --Bob Claypool","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41890ebfc0bea855a035958bc1560301f0a73a92","amp;dn":"Bluegrass+Album+Band+-+Vol.+3+%281983%29+MP3+320kbs+%28WCS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41890ebfc0bea855a035958bc1560301f0a73a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,137,14,191,192,190,168,85,160,53,149,139,193,86,3,1,240,167,58,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
