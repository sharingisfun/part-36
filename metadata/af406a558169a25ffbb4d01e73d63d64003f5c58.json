One night after a family dispute, Abbey sneaks out and heads to Arizona to meet Gavinâ€”the 23-year-old handsome guy she knows only through a chat website. Upon meeting Gavin in person, she immediately notices that he is much older than he looks online. When Julia sees that Abbey is gone, she gets access into Abbeyâ€™s social media profiles to track her down and save her before Gavin reveals his true intentions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af406a558169a25ffbb4d01e73d63d64003f5c58","amp;dn":"16.And.Missing.2015.HDTV.x264-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af406a558169a25ffbb4d01e73d63d64003f5c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,64,106,85,129,105,162,95,251,180,208,30,115,214,61,100,0,63,92,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
