Design from the chassis up, then pit your creation against humans or AI in a combat arena. When you take out other players, scavenge from their wreckage to repair or upgrade your own vehicle in-game.\r\n\r\nScraps lets you create a vehicle thatâ€™s great or a vehicle that sucks. Maybe your vehicle falls over when it corners or doesn't have enough power to fire its weapons â€“ thatâ€™s okay. Maybe it doesn't need an engine because it moves by firing its cannons backwards. You decide what you drive.\r\n\r\nYour design choices aren't just cosmetic - they're truly functional and at the very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle. Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the Internet. Easily host your own LAN or Internet games. Using the Scraps demo, your friends can join a LAN game even if they don't own the full game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:668e786b087413ca715f3dbc4563de909b2c8dce","amp;dn":"Scraps%3A+Modular+Vehicle+Combat+v0.5.2.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"668e786b087413ca715f3dbc4563de909b2c8dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,142,120,107,8,116,19,202,113,95,61,188,69,99,222,144,155,44,141,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
