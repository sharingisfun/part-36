The Punch Brothers consist of Thile at the wheel, fiddler Gabe Witcher, guitarist Chris Eldridge, banjo player Noam Pikelny, and bassist Greg Garrison, all of whom share their bandleader&amp;#039;s impeccable chops and unpredictability. The group&amp;#039;s heady debut begins innocently enough with the serpentine yet reasonably catchy &quot;Punch Bowl,&quot; a song that wouldn&amp;#039;t have sounded out of place on Strength in Numbers&amp;#039; Telluride Sessions, but from there, things take a left turn (this is a band that routinely works covers of Radiohead and the Strokes into their live set), and a rewarding one at that. Thile&amp;#039;s four movement/forty-minute &quot;Blind Leading the Blind&quot; suite is heavy (as in divorce, loss, love, and redemption heavy), but it&amp;#039;s also exhilarating. It ebbs and flows with little concern for conventional structure or traditional narrative, bursting into frenetic picking and dissolving into gentle harmonics whenever it chooses, layering even-handed, vibrato-free sections of close harmony singing over increasingly dissonant chord progressions that warrant repeated listens even as they unfold. It&amp;#039;s a bold move, and one that straddles pretense all the way through without ever succumbing. Traditional bluegrass fans will no doubt require multiple mugs of Punch, and even then they may never quite get it, but if you relish the idea of BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck, Turtle Island String Quartet, and Jim O&amp;#039;Rourke getting together for a friendly meal of reconstruction and catharsis, then your dinner is most certainly ready. \n\n-=Product Description=-\n\nThe Punch Brothers are nothing less than a youthful band comprising the most prodigious and sought-after musicians from the cutting edge of bluegrass and folk music. The quintet was brought together by former Nickel Creek star Chris Thile, who, the critic Geoffrey Himes of Washington Post declared, &quot;may well be the most virtuosic American ever to play the mandolin &quot;ÃƒÂ¢?? adding, not insignificantly, that &quot;he has the flirtatious charisma of a major pop star.&quot; Joining him are Chris Eldridge, who Acoustic Guitar has called &quot;the most-talked-about guitarist in the bluegrass world,&quot; a member of The Infamous Stringdusters and occasional guest star with dad BenÃƒÂ¢??s legendary combo, The Seldom Scene; bassist Greg Garrison, who has recorded with John Scofield and Vasser Clements, among many others, and regularly sits in with Leftover Salmon; banjo player Noam Pikelny, an alumnus of Leftover Salmon and the John Cowan Band who also appears on label-mate K.D. LangÃƒÂ¢??s new disc, Watershed; and fiddle player Gabe Witcher, &quot;a first-call studio player with a big sound and immaculate intonation,&quot; according to String magazine, who has been featured, on the Oscar-winning soundtracks of Babel and Brokeback Mountain, among countless other films.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Punch Brothers - Punch\n                                             \nArtist ....: Punch Brothers                  \nAlbum .....: Punch                           \nGenre .....: Bluegrass                       \nLabel .....: Nonesuch Records                \nCatalog # .: 181732                          \nLanguage ..: English                         \n                                             \nSource ....: CDDA                            \nGrabber ...: EAC v0.95b4                     \nEncoder ...: LAME v3.97 -V2                  \nBitrate ...: VBRkbps                         \nSize ......: 73,6 MB                         \n                                             \nRel. date .: Mar-02-2008                     \nStr. date .:                                 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        [    TRACK LiST    ]                        \n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n            THIS IS *NOT* A SUBSTITUDE OF THE ORIGINAL.             \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    \nNB   TRACKNAMES:                                          LENGHT:   \n                                                                    \n01.
