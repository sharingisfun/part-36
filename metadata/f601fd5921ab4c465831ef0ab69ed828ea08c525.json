This is the Native Instruments Battery 3 Library ISO DVD 1 of 2. I downloaded this from emule (DVD 2 at 7.68 GB coming in a day or two!!!). Included is the Battery 3 setup but I didn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t test it for crack/patch/keygen. Instead I downloaded the 79 MB torrent of Battery 3 by AMPLiFY which works like a charm but no library is included, so here it is, part 1 of 2. I quickly checked the structure and everything seems in oreder. No viruses or whatsoever. I will seed until at least 5 people have downloaded it completely, than I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll delete it. Sorry folks, I have a limited size HDD, but I\\\\\\&amp;#039;m investing in a new one soon. Please feel free to leave coments. Best, Pressduck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f601fd5921ab4c465831ef0ab69ed828ea08c525","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+Battery+3+Library+DVD+1+of+2+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f601fd5921ab4c465831ef0ab69ed828ea08c525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,1,253,89,33,171,76,70,88,49,239,10,182,158,216,40,234,8,197,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
