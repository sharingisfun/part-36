DaleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s testimony helps send his partner away for murder, the consequences - and the media frenzy - arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t far behind. He soon finds himself sans boyfriend, sans friends, and, after an unpleasant encounter in a parking garage after the trial, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lucky he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find himself sans teeth. Dex fears heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get transferred from the Human Police ForceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sixth Precinct, or worse, get dismissed. Instead, his adoptive father - a sergeant at the Therian-Human Intelligence Recon Defense Squadron otherwise known as the THIRDS - pulls a few strings, and Dex gets recruited as a Defense Agent.\n\nDex is determined to get his life back on track and eager to get started in his new job. But his first meeting with Team Leader Sloane Brodie, who also happens to be his new jaguar Therian partner, turns disastrous. When the team is called to investigate the murders of three HumaniTherian activists, it soon becomes clear to Dex that getting his partner and the rest of the tightknit team to accept him will be a lot harder than catching the killer - and every bit as dangerous.\n\nBlood &amp; Thunder: (THIRDS Book 2)\n    Written by: Charlie Cochet\n    Narrated by: Mark Westfield\n    Length: 7 hrs and 50 mins \n       Unabridged Audiobook \nWhen a series of bombs go off in a Therian youth center, injuring members of THIRDS Team Destructive Delta and causing a rift between agents Dexter J. Daley and Sloane Brodie, peace seems unattainable. Especially when a new and frightening group, the Order of Adrasteia, appears to always be a step ahead. With panic and intolerance spreading and streets becoming littered with the Order's propaganda, hostility between Humans and Therians grows daily. Dex and Sloane, along with the rest of the team, are determined to take down the Order and restore peace, not to mention settle a personal score. But the deeper the team investigates the bombings, the more they believe there's a more sinister motive than a desire to shed blood and spread chaos.\n\nDiscovering the frightful truth behind the Order's intent forces Sloane to confront secrets from a past he thought he'd left behind for good, a past that could not only destroy him and his career, but also the reputation of the organization that made him all he is today. Now more than ever, Dex and Sloane need each other, and, along with trust, the strength of their bond will mean the difference between justice and all-out war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde1208c6ff1a38f7f7bb6240c31e5d5b9191892","amp;dn":"Charlie+Cochet+-+THIRDS+Book+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde1208c6ff1a38f7f7bb6240c31e5d5b9191892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,225,32,140,111,241,163,143,127,123,182,36,12,49,229,213,185,25,24,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
