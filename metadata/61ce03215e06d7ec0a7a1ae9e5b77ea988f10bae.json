It was the most powerful maritime fighting force in the world, with highly trained crews and ambitious officers. He explores the national enterprise which supported it, and explains how the empire it helped create put Britain on the path to war with France.\n\nThrough the stories of naval heroes like Captain Cook, naval administrators like Charles Middleton and of course Admiral Nelson, Snow explores the elite training, the growing naval meritocracy and the years of tough experience which created a ruthless and professional 'Band of Brothers'. He looks at the impact of innovations such as the copper bottoming of the navy's ships and the introduction of a new tax - income tax - to pay for the fleet.\n\nPushing back the boundaries of the known world, the navy's highly trained crews and ambitious officers laid claim to a burgeoning empire, but at a huge price. By 1800, Britain had been dragged into the greatest sequence of wars the nation had ever seen.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.0\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59 minutes\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.70GB\nSubtitles: merged\nRipped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ce03215e06d7ec0a7a1ae9e5b77ea988f10bae","amp;dn":"BBC+Empire+of+the+Seas+3of4+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ce03215e06d7ec0a7a1ae9e5b77ea988f10bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,206,3,33,94,6,215,236,10,122,26,233,229,183,126,169,136,241,11,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
