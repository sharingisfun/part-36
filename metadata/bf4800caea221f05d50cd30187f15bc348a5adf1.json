It became the band's commercial breakthrough, reaching #12 on the UK singles chart in May 1981. \n\nWritten jointly by lead singer Philip Oakey and keyboard player Ian Burden, the song was recorded at Genetic Sound Studios, Reading, in March 1981. Originally released as a stand-alone single in April 1981, it was subsequently re-recorded and incorporated into the studio album Dare, later in the year. \n\n&quot;The Sound Of The Crowd&quot; was the first Human League song to feature female vocals from new band members Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall, interacting with Philip Oakey's baritone lead. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_the_Crowd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_the_Crowd&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAbPnAADG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAbPnAADG&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: DivX 6 704x544 23.98fps 4470kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:27\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
