All of the tracks are unfinished, or demo versions, of each track on &quot;The Slider.&quot; Highlights include the smoother Metal Guru (sans yelling/backing vocals,) the completely different Buick Mackane, and the super romantic acoustic version of Cadilac. A great revisit to a classic album. \n\n'Rabbit Fighter - The Alternate Slider' [320k MP3]\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Metal Guru  \n02. Mystic Lady  \n03. Rock On  \n04. The Slider  \n05.

It was the first album released on Bolan's new founded EMI / T.Rex Wax Co label distributed through EMI. It became T. Rex's most popular album in the United States on Reprise label, reaching #17, featuring the singles &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; and &quot;Metal Guru&quot;. Both singles topped the UK Singles Chart but neither of became hits in the U.S. (&quot;Telegram Sam&quot; only scraped to #67 and &quot;Metal Guru&quot; didn't chart). The much-parodied iconic cover was #37 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest album covers.\n\nThe Slider came on the heels of the success of Electric Warrior, and many said that timing probably helped The Slider's own success.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6456654aff71bcbfd0ff25a940464181f22a87f","amp;dn":"T.+Rex+-+%5C%27Rabbit+Fighter-The+Alternate+Slider%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6456654aff71bcbfd0ff25a940464181f22a87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,69,102,84,175,247,27,203,253,15,242,90,148,4,100,24,31,34,168,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
