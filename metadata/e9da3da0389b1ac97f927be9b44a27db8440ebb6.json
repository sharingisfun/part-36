Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\n\nGuests: Tom Segura, Christina Pazsitzky\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9da3da0389b1ac97f927be9b44a27db8440ebb6","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+Podcast+%23296+Mix+Master+Mike+%5B64k+Time+Warp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9da3da0389b1ac97f927be9b44a27db8440ebb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,218,61,160,56,155,26,201,127,146,123,233,180,74,39,219,132,64,235,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
