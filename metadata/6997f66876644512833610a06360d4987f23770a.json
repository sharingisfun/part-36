Even if you are not a small business owner, FRSProductMgr's very flexible and powerful design can help you manage and publish just about any content.\n\nKey Features:\n\nEasy, flexible design.\nCan be used for just about any business.\nTrack any kind of product data.\nNew! Filter by manufacturer for easier data-entry.\nTrack customers' information.\nTie products and customers together for orders.\nIf using PayPal, can analyze PayPal order e-mails.\nCan report on any data using custom, internal reports.\nHas a handy &quot;to-do&quot; list.\nCan generate and upload product web pages.\nThorough, easy-to-use online documentation.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nProduct data entry is simple and straightforward, as can be seen in the above screen capture of FRSProductMgr's Products tab. There are many tools provided for getting your data into the application. Once the data has been entered into the application, you can use it to generate on-screen reports (via the Reports tab), and/or create web pages from that data. Web pages are generated by combining your store's data along with some HTML-based template files. The template files allow the person maintaining your web site to format the pages so that they look just like the rest of your web site, yet use the custom data entered into FRSProductMgr.\nFRSProductMgr's enormous flexibility is in the way it lets you determine just exactly which data you want to track for each of your products. You can add data columns, remove or hide them, rename them, etc. (some restrictions apply). You can add as many photos as you want for each product. If your products go on sale from time to time, you can set the sale price, and you can even set the date range for when that sale price is in effect.\nWhen you select a product, you can, optionally, provide a full description of the item in a separate, dedicated field below the spreadsheet on the left. Note that you can embed HTML tags within this product description text for added flexibility (primarily of use when products are displayed in product web pages on your web site).\n\nA Few More Features:\n\nYou can control the font used in the grids and the Products tab's Product Description edit field.\nYour data is not &quot;trapped&quot;. It can be exported to an external text, or copied to the Windows Clipboard.\nThere are many ways to sort your product inventory.\nEasily create and print reports.\nImport your existing data.\nSeveral data manipulation tools are provided.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 and 8\n\n\nHomepage: http://www.fourthray.com/Products/FRSProductMgr/index.php\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Copy content from crack folder and paste into default installation directory.\n- Done, Enjoy. \n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6997f66876644512833610a06360d4987f23770a","amp;dn":"Fourth+Ray+Software+FRSProductMgr+v2.1.1+Incl+Crack+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6997f66876644512833610a06360d4987f23770a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,151,246,104,118,100,69,18,131,54,16,160,99,96,212,152,127,35,119,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
