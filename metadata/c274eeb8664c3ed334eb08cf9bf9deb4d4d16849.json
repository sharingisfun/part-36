And if they are, according to their standards, decent, they are welcomed to be their friend. And if not the planet is destroyed. To find out they choose one inhabitant and give that person the power to do whatever he/she wants. And they choose Neil Clarke, a teacher who teaches the special kids. He is constantly being berated by the headmaster and is attracted to his neighbor, Catherine but doesn't have the guts to approach her. But now he can do anything he wants but has to be careful.                \r\n\r\nYear: 2015                \r\nDirector: Terry Jones                \r\nWriters: Gavin Scott, Terry Jones                \r\nStars: Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Rob Riggle, Robert Bathurst, Eddie Izzard, Joanna Lumley, Marianne Oldham, Emma Pierson, Meera Syal                \r\nGenres: Comedy, Sci-Fi                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Absolutely.Anything.2015.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x536                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / AC3 / 192kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 697MB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/absolutely-anything/2015/absolutely-anything-2015-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
