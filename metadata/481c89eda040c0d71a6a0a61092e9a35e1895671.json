Popper, &quot;Food Over Medicine: The Conversation That Could Save Your Life&quot;\nISBN: 1937856801 | 2013 | EPUB\n\nIncludes recipes from Chef Del Sroufe, author of the bestselling Forks Over KnivesÃ¢â‚¬â€The Cookbook and Better Than Vegan\n\nNearly half of Americans take at least one prescription medicine, with almost a quarter taking three or more, as diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and dementia grow more prevalent than ever. The problem with medicating common ailments, such as high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol, is that drugs treat symptomsÃ¢â‚¬â€and may even improve test resultsÃ¢â‚¬â€without addressing the cause: diet.\n\nOvermedicated, overfed, and malnourished, most Americans fail to realize the answer to lower disease rates doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lie in more pills but in the foods we eat.With so much misleading nutritional information regarded as common knowledge, from Ã¢â‚¬Å“everything in moderationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“avoid carbs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the average American is ill-equipped to recognize the deadly force of abundant, cheap, unhealthy food options that not only offer no nutritional benefits but actually bring on disease.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:481c89eda040c0d71a6a0a61092e9a35e1895671","amp;dn":"Food+Over+Medicine%3A+The+Conversation+That+Could+Save+Your+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"481c89eda040c0d71a6a0a61092e9a35e1895671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,28,137,237,160,64,192,215,26,106,10,97,9,46,154,53,225,137,86,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
