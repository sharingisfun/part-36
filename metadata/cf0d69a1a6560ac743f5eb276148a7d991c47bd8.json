Milne. Gently paced, subtly humorous, and blessedly understated, this adaptation reflects Walt Disney&amp;#039;s original vision to develop the beloved British bear for a wider audience. The film is essentially a collection of the original Pooh shorts, &quot;The Honey Tree,&quot; &quot;The Blustery Day,&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too.&quot; These storybooks are presented in seamless &quot;chapters,&quot; narrated by the timeless Sebastian Cabot. The familiar musical score and original voices of Sterling Holloway as Pooh, and Paul Winchell as Tigger, cap this enchanting keepsake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0d69a1a6560ac743f5eb276148a7d991c47bd8","amp;dn":"The.Many.Adventures.Of.Winnie.The.Pooh.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0d69a1a6560ac743f5eb276148a7d991c47bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,13,105,161,166,86,10,199,67,245,235,39,97,72,167,217,145,196,123,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
