He has been performing since the late 1950s and recording from 1965 to the present. He has worked with many of the notable guitarists of the English folk music revival, such as John Renbourn and Bert Jansch\n\nbecame infatuated with the bohemian image of Woody Guthrie and Jack Kerouac and grew his hair long. His mother had started calling him Wizzy after the Beano comic strip character &quot;Wizzy the Wuz&quot; because at the age of nine Raymond was a budding Musician. The nickname stuck throughout his school years and when he formed his first band &quot;The Wranglers&quot; in 1957 the name became permanent. Bert Jansch later said &quot;I think he's the most underrated guitarist ever&quot;. In the early 1960s he went busking in Paris, France, and there mixed in an artistic circle that included Rod Stewart, Alex Campbell, Clive Palmer (Incredible String Band) and Ralph McTell. After a couple of years in Paris he married and returned to England to raise a family. In 1965 his only single was released: Bob Dylan's &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot;. By this time the skiffle boom was over but one of the stars of that movement, Chas McDevitt, used Jones' guitar-playing on five albums in 1965 and 1966. Another musician on those sessions was the bluegrass banjo-player, Pete Stanley. In 1966 Jones and Stanley released an album Sixteen Tons of Bluegrass, but this partnership broke down in 1967, as Jones then turned solo\n\nJones started to became a singer-songwriter. His first solo album was Wizz Jones in 1969. Up to 1988, ten solo albums followed and he played on Ralph McTellÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee2263d226b25c195a8aceac599c727369a81e1","amp;dn":"Wizz+Jones...The+Legendary+Me%281970%29CD%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee2263d226b25c195a8aceac599c727369a81e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,226,38,61,34,107,37,193,149,168,172,234,197,153,199,39,54,154,129,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
