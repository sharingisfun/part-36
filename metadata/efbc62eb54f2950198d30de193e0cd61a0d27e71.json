The renditions of pop standards are okay, and the covers of pop-rock hits like &quot;Satsifaction,&quot; &quot;Homeward Bound,&quot; and &quot;Route 66&quot; mediocre-to-embarrassing; there are also some tunes like &quot;Change of Heart&quot; that are reasonable continuations of her pure pop singles of the mid-'60s. It's a very uneven effort--selected tracks will be enjoyed by her fan club, but it will convert few new listeners to her cause.
