Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.\n\nBy late 1976, bands such as the Ramones, in New York City, and the Sex Pistols and The Clash, in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly, though briefly, became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and Oi! had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to post-punk and the alternative rock movement. By the turn of the century, pop punk had been adopted by the mainstream, with bands such as Green Day and The Offspring bringing the genre widespread popularity.\n\n\nSka\n\n\nSka (pronounced /Ãƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ skÃƒâ€°Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒâ€¹Ã‚ï¿½/, Jamaican [skja]) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae.[1] Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.[2][3][4][5]\n\nMusic historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave), the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave) and the third wave ska movement, which started in the 1980s (Third Wave) and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s. [/quote]\n\n\nNo Alternative 1993\n\n\nAlternative is a 1993 alternative rock compilation album released to benefit AIDS organizations. The album features original tracks and cover versions from bands who went on to define the alternative rock scene of the 1990s. It was released with two different versions of album art; the standard version depicticting a boy (without the Nirvana song listed on the back and liner notes), and the alternate version depicting a girl (with the Nirvana song listed on the back and liner notes; however, some CDs have the girl but no Nirvana mention).\n\nA television special hosted by MTV and a VHS home video release featured live performances, music videos, and information about AIDS.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Superdeformed&quot; (Matthew Sweet) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n2.\t&quot;For All to See&quot; (Buffalo Tom) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n3.\t&quot;Sexual Healing&quot; (Odell Brown, Marvin Gaye, David Ritz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45 \no\tperformed by Soul Asylum\n4.\t&quot;Take a Walk&quot; (Urge Overkill) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n5.\t&quot;All Your Jeans Were Too Tight&quot; (Mark Eitzel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \no\tperformed by American Music Club\n6.\t&quot;Bitch&quot; (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17 \no\tperformed by Goo Goo Dolls with Lance Diamond\n7.\t&quot;Unseen Power of the Picket Fence&quot; (Pavement) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n8.\t&quot;Glynis&quot; (Billy Corgan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53 \no\tperformed by The Smashing Pumpkins\n9.\t&quot;CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Fight It&quot; (Bob Mould) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n10.\t&quot;Hold On&quot; (Sarah McLachlan) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n11.\t&quot;Show Me&quot; (Ben Shepherd) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48 \no\tperformed by Soundgarden\n12.\t&quot;Brittle&quot; (Shayne Carter, Straitjacket Fits) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 \no\tperformed by Straitjacket Fits\n13.\t&quot;Joed Out&quot; (Graeme Downes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 \no\tperformed by Barbara Manning and the San Francisco Seals\n14.\t&quot;Heavy 33&quot; (Graeme Downes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21 \no\tperformed by The Verlaines\n15.\t&quot;Effigy&quot; (John Fogerty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59 \no\tperformed by Uncle Tupelo\n16.\t&quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the New Style&quot; (Beastie Boys, Rick Rubin) (live) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20 \no\tperformed by Beastie Boys and DJ Hurricane\n17.\t&quot;Iris&quot; (Kim Deal) (live) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \no\tperformed by The Breeders\n18. &quot;Memorial Tribute&quot; (Patti Smith) (live) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n\n\n\n[b]Alternative Route '94 [/b] 1994\n\n[URL=http://img685.imageshack.us/i/alternativeroute94.jpg/][IMG]http://a.imageshack.us/img685/41/alternativeroute94.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nPromotional Copy from Cargo Records\n\n[b]Tracks: [/b]\n\n\n[b]Disc 1:[/b]\n\n\n1.

It spawned the 2 Tone music and cultural movement, which was popular among skinheads, rudies and some mod revivalists. The label stopped operating in 1986. 2 Tone Records signed The Selecter, Madness and The Beat, but they all left within two years. 2 Tone Records acts signed a contract that allowed them to leave the label after releasing just one single, which was unusual in the record industry. Madness and The Beat both took advantage of this clause; the former to sign to Stiff Records, and the latter to start their own label, Go Feet Records.\n\nAlthough 2 Tone Records was closely identified with the ska revival, efforts were made to broaden the label's musical output, releasing recordings by artists such as singer-songwriter Elvis Costello and the funk-punk band The Higsons. Two bands that almost made it onto the label were UB40 and Dexys Midnight Runners.[citation needed]\n\nJerry Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter, created artwork that was to become central to 2 Tone Records. The Walt Jabsco logo portrays a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers. The fictional character was based on a photograph of Peter Tosh, a former member of The Wailers.\n\n[b]Tracks: [/b]\n\n1. Message To You Rudy - The Specials\n2. Prince - Madness\n3.

The first volume was released in 1994, the second in 1996, and the rest annually from 1998 to 2005. The albums included artists from Epitaph's roster as well as from its subsidiary label ANTI- and its partnership labels Hellcat Records and Burning Heart Records. In total the series included 257 songs contributed by 88 different artists.\n\nAs its title implied, the series featured mostly punk rock and various punk subgenres such as garage punk, hardcore punk, pop punk, post-hardcore, ska punk, skate punk, and street punk. However, as the series went on and the labels' rosters diversified, the music of the Punk-O-Rama compilations grew to include additional styles of music such as alternative hip hop, alternative rock, digital hardcore, emo, experimental music, garage rock, indie rock, metalcore, psychobilly, and screamo.\n\nArtwork for the series was inconsistent over the first four installments, with cover art and layout provided by varying artists and designers. C. Martin provided artwork and layout for both the fifth and sixth volumes, though they had differing styles and themes. Nick Pritchard of Metrosea.com provided artwork and layout for the final four volumes of the series, which adopted a more uniform look and style.\n\nEpitaph also organized several Punk-O-Rama tours featuring bands that had contributed to the compilations, such as Agnostic Front, All, The Distillers, Guttermouth, Millencolin, Straight Faced, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Occasionally these would be accompanied by special Punk-O-Rama tour sampler CDs that differed from the main series of compilation albums. In 2003 the label published the DVD Punk-O-Rama: The Videos, Volume 1, including 22 music videos and &quot;The Epitaph Story&quot;, a short film relating the history of the label. Though a second volume was never published, the subsequent ninth and tenth albums in the compilation series included DVDs of music videos as well.\n\nIn 2006 Epitaph announced the retirement of the Punk-O-Rama brand in favor of a new series titled Unsound,[1] the less genre-specific title being more conducive to the label's expanding roster of musical styles. However, to date only one compilation has been published under the Unsound banner.\n\n\n\n[b]Punkorama 7 [/b] 2002\n\n[URL=http://img821.imageshack.us/i/punkorama7.jpg/][IMG]http://a.imageshack.us/img821/1015/punkorama7.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nPunk-O-Rama Vol. 7 is the seventh compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series.\n\n[b]Tracks: [/b]\n\n1.\t&quot;Fingers Crossed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Millencolin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:47\n2.\t&quot;Wayfarer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hot Water Music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n3.\t&quot;Up for Sale&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The (International) Noise Conspiracy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n4.\t&quot;The World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pennywise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26\n5.\t&quot;Black City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Division of Laura Lee ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n6.\t&quot;Olympia, WA&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ NOFX ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n7.\t&quot;Addicts of Communication&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Randy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n8.\t&quot;Hooray for Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pulley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19\n9.\t&quot;The Something Special&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Bouncing Souls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n10.\t&quot;God Knows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Beatsteaks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n11.\t&quot;The Defense&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bad Religion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n12.\t&quot;The End&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Deviates ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n13.\t&quot;Heroes from Our Past&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dropkick Murphys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n14.\t&quot;Bob&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rancid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n15.\t&quot;Wasted Words&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Death by Stereo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n16.\t&quot;Love to Be Hated&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Agnostic Front ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n17.\t&quot;Outside Looking In&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1208 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n18.\t&quot;M.A.D.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 98 Mute ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n19.\t&quot;My Girlfriend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guttermouth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n\n\n[b]Punkorama 8 [/b] 2003\n\n[URL=http://img638.imageshack.us/i/punkorama8.jpg/][IMG]http://a.imageshack.us/img638/8215/punkorama8.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nPunk-O-Rama Vol. 8 is the eighth compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series.
