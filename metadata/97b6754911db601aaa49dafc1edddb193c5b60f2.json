Why do some companies flourish in tough times while others fail? Why are some countries more productive than others?\n\nThrough an entertaining mix of examples from the business world, insights from innovation gurus, little-known research, the experiences of business leaders and her own candid stories of life off-camera, Amanda Lang explains how asking the right questions has changed the world and how it can change you, too. From the invention of the curved shower curtain rod to the introduction of an elevator that creates electricity as it moves from floor to floor, The Power of Why persuasively spells out the connection between innovation and productivity that is so crucial in the knowledge economy.\n\nInstead of obsessing over working Ã¢â‚¬Å“smarter,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we ought to focus on the instinctive urge to question thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so natural for young children. As Lang shows, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to reignite that instinct at any age and to become more innovative and productiveÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as more fulfilled in our jobs and happier in our relationships. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the power of why.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97b6754911db601aaa49dafc1edddb193c5b60f2","amp;dn":"The+Power+Of+Why+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97b6754911db601aaa49dafc1edddb193c5b60f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,182,117,73,17,219,96,26,170,73,218,252,30,221,219,25,60,91,96,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
