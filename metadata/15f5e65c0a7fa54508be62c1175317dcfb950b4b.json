In The End of the Line, POLITICO senior White House reporter Glenn Thrush and senior political reporter Jonathan Martin chronicle every hairpin turn in a race that defied the predictions of pundits and prognosticators.\n \nWhile some political observers considered Barack ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reelection far from a sure thing, the president and his team remained resolute in their belief that they would prevail. In Boston, Mitt RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advisers were just as confident that their man was headed for a smashing victory. In the end, only one of those views would be validated by events. The outcome of this election was never foreordained, however, and would ultimately be determined by two candidates, three debates, and a thousand small but critical strategic decisions.
