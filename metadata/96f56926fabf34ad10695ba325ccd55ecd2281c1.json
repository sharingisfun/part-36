Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.\n\nDirected by David O. Russell\n\nProduced by Bruce Cohen\nDonna Gigliotti\n\nStarring:\nBradley Cooper\nJennifer Lawrence\nRobert De Niro\nJacki Weaver\nChris Tucker\nAnupam Kher\n\nRelease date(s)\nSeptember 8, 2012 (TIFF)\nNovember 16, 2012 (USA)\n\nRunning time 122 minutes[2]\nCountry United States\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\n\nIn 2008, Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released from a mental health facility into the care of his parents after eight months of treatment for bipolar disorder. During his time there, he forms a close friendship with a fellow patient, Danny (Chris Tucker), who is having legal disputes with the hospital which constantly prevents him from leaving. Pat soon learns that his wife, Nikki, has moved away and his father, Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), is out of work and resorting to bookmaking to earn money to start a restaurant. Pat is determined to get his life back on track and reconcile with Nikki, who obtained a restraining order against him after the violent episode that sent him away.\n\nWhile talking to his court-mandated therapist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat explains again why he was hospitalized. Coming home early from his high school teaching job, noticing clothes thrown on the floor and his wedding songÃ¢â‚¬â€Stevie Wonder's &quot;My Cherie Amour&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€playing, he had found Nikki in the shower, with another man. Enraged, he nearly beat the man to death. Despite this, Pat doesn't believe he needs medication to manage his condition.\n\nAt dinner with his friend Ronnie, he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a sex addict and recent widow who also just lost her job. Pat and Tiffany develop an odd friendship through their shared neuroses, and he sees an opportunity to communicate with Nikki through her. Tiffany offers to deliver a letter to Nikki, if in return he will be her partner in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks, with help from Danny, who is eventually released. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki he has changed and become a better man. Tiffany gives Pat a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may be a chance for a reconciliation between them.\n\nThings go well for Pat until his father asks him to attend a Philadelphia Eagles game he has bet virtually all of his money on, as a &quot;good-luck charm.&quot; Pat skips practice with Tiffany to attend the game, but is dragged into a fight with racist thugs attacking his psychiatrist and brother, and is hauled away by police. The Eagles lose the game and Pat Sr. is furious. Tiffany arrives, berates Pat, and points out that the way she &quot;reads the signs,&quot; the Eagles do better when she and Pat are together, as they won every game they played on occasions when Pat and Tiffany spent time together. Pat Sr., now convinced that Pat being with Tiffany is actually good luck, makes a parlay with his gambling friend that if the Eagles win their game against Dallas, and if Pat and Tiffany score at least a 5 out of 10 in their dance competition, he will win back all the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant to participate in the dance contest under those conditions; however, Tiffany and Pat's father decide to persuade Pat by lying to him to say Nikki will be there. In the mean time, Pat, who has isolated himself from everyone, begins to read the letter from Nikki again and notices that the phrase Tiffany had used earlierÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;reading the signs&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€appears in the letter.\n\nPat, Tiffany, and everyone else arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany is horrified to discover that Nikki is in the audience. Pat finds Tiffany, who has been drinking with a man who was trying to pick her up, and manages to coax her onto the dance floor, where they perform their routine. Before they dance, the Eagles win their game and at the conclusion of their set, they score exactly 5 points.\n\nPat and Tiffany are elated. Amid cheers from his family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and storms off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after only a short conversation, intent on finding Tiffany. Pat Sr. informs him that Tiffany left, and tells him that she loves him right now and that it will be a sin if he doesn't reach out to this moment that life has given him. Pat tells his father that he loves him, then chases after Tiffany and tells her he knows she forged Nikki's letter. He confesses he has loved her from the moment he met her but has taken a long time to realize it and they kiss. They become a couple and Pat Sr. moves forward with opening the restaurant with the money he has won.
