Together with his companions they travel through time and space in the TARDIS, battling evil where they find it.\n\n\nThis collection contains every series from the 2005 reboot until the end of Matt Smith's run.  I have included all of the Christmas specials, and the extra episodes at the end of the 10th doctor's run at the end of series 4.  Since I'm something of a purist, I started the season numbering at 27, since that's really where we are in the entire show's history.  I also placed each Christmas Special or special episodes at the ends of the preceding season.  For example, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; is at the end of season 1's show list.  \n\nI did not include the minisodes, like &quot;The Pond Life&quot; or any of the &quot;Doctor Who at the Proms&quot; or the &quot;Children in Need&quot;.  This is the bare-bones collection of every major episode released by BBC1.  \n\nFormats: avi, mp4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90bee5067d4f645502673eaeaf628c953d16d833","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+2005+Seasons+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+%26amp%3B+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90bee5067d4f645502673eaeaf628c953d16d833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,190,229,6,125,79,100,85,2,103,62,174,175,98,140,149,61,22,216,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
