His backup group (organist Paul Griffin, guitarist Lord Westbrook, bassist Leonard Gaskin and drummer Herbie Lovelle) is fine in support, but the spotlight is almost entirely on Witherspoon throughout these ten concise performances, only one of which exceeds four minutes. Highlights include &quot;No Rollin' Blues,&quot; &quot;S.K. Blues&quot; and &quot;Around the Clock.&quot; Witherspoon is in fine voice and, even if nothing all that memorable occurs, the music is enjoyable.\n\ntrack list:\n\n01.
