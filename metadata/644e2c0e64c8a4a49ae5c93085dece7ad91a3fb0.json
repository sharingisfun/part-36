It was released in 1996. This is the first album with Johnny Kelly credited as the band's drummer. October Rust has more ballads and less of the doom metal sound of previous or subsequent albums. It also features a much heavier cover of Neil Young's &quot;Cinnamon Girl.&quot;\r\n\r\nIt is the first of the band's albums with a &quot;joke intro&quot;; in this case, the intro, &quot;Bad Ground&quot;, is 38 seconds of low-level buzzing, meant to sound as if the listener's speakers are incorrectly plugged in. The second and fifteenth tracks are humorous untitled intros and outros to the album, respectively, with the band downplaying the recording of the album. Another production technique employed on the album is the use of very abrupt endings and segues to a few of the songs, like &quot;Green Man&quot;, &quot;Red Water&quot; and &quot;Haunted&quot;.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Peter Steele except where noted.\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Bad Ground&quot;   \t0:38\r\n2. \tUntitled   \t0:21\r\n3. \t&quot;Love You to Death&quot;   \t7:08\r\n4. \t&quot;Be My Druidess&quot;   \t5:25\r\n5. \t&quot;Green Man&quot;   \t5:47\r\n6. \t&quot;Red Water (Christmas Mourning)&quot;   \t6:48\r\n7. \t&quot;My Girlfriend's Girlfriend&quot;   \t3:46\r\n8. \t&quot;Die With Me&quot;   \t7:12\r\n9. \t&quot;Burnt Flowers Fallen&quot;   \t6:09\r\n10. \t&quot;In Praise of Bacchus&quot; (Featuring &quot;Val Ium&quot; of Pist.On) \t7:36\r\n11. \t&quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; (Neil Young) \t4:00\r\n12. \t&quot;The Glorious Liberation of the People's Technocratic Republic of Vinnland by the Combined Forces of the United Territories of Europa&quot;   \t1:07\r\n13. \t&quot;Wolf Moon (Including Zoanthropic Paranoia)&quot;   \t6:37\r\n14. \t&quot;Haunted&quot;   \t10:07\r\n15. \tUntitled   \t0:08\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n    Peter Steele â€“ lead vocals, bass guitar\r\n    Kenny Hickey â€“ guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Josh Silver â€“ keyboards, effects, backing vocals\r\n    Johnny Kelly â€“ drums, percussions, backing vocals\r\n\r\nAdditional vocal performance on &quot;In Praise of Bacchus&quot; by Val Ium, courtesy of Pist.On. \r\n\r\nBy Request you know who you are","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:644e2c0e64c8a4a49ae5c93085dece7ad91a3fb0","amp;dn":"Type+O+Negative+-+October+Rust+%281996%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"644e2c0e64c8a4a49ae5c93085dece7ad91a3fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,78,44,14,100,200,164,164,154,229,201,48,133,222,206,122,217,26,63,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
