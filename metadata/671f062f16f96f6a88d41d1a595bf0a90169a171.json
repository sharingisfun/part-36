M.K.) (Amanda Seyfried), a 17 year old teenager, moves in with her estranged and eccentric scientist father, Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis), who has been searching for tiny human soldiers, about which M.K. is skeptical. She wants her father to stop his work. Unknown to the both of them, Bomba is right that there are tiny soldiers called Leafmen. They protect the forest Bomba lives near from evil creatures called Boggans (who shoot arrows that can kill any living thing) and their malevolent leader Mandrake (Christoph Waltz) who plans to destroy the forest. An independent young soldier, Nod (Josh Hutcherson) decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leafmen leader Ronin (Colin Farrell) who wants Nod to learn about teamwork.\n\nThe queen of the forest, Queen Tara (BeyoncÃƒÂ© Knowles), who is aware of Ronin's apparent attraction to her, decides to choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods, guarded by a laid-back slug named Mub (Aziz Ansari) and an uptight snail named Grub (Chris O'Dowd). Tara chooses the smallest pod as the heir. Immediately after she does so, the Boggans attack. Tara flees the area with the pod, and though her bodyguards do their best to protect her, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of Boggans. Tara uses her magic to slow down her pursuers, and is at one point rescued by a flower child who idolizes her. Eventually, Ronin arrives for her and the pair fly off on Ronin's hummingbird mount. They are then attacked by Mandrake and his son Dagda (Blake Anderson). Dagda is killed by Ronin, but Tara is shot when Dagda shoots an arrow, so she falls off Ronin's bird into the forest.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671f062f16f96f6a88d41d1a595bf0a90169a171","amp;dn":"EPIC+DVDRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671f062f16f96f6a88d41d1a595bf0a90169a171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,31,6,47,22,249,111,106,136,212,29,26,89,91,240,169,1,105,161,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
