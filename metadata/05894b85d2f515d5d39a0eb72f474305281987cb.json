Enhanced by a wealth of online support that is seamlessly integrated with the program, Chemistry's solid explanations, emphasis on modeling, and outstanding problem sets make both teaching and learning chemistry more meaningful and accessible than ever before. The authors emphasize a qualitative approach to chemistry in both the text and the technology program before quantitative problems are considered, helping to build comprehension. The emphasis on modeling throughout the narrative addresses the problem of rote memorization by helping students to better understand and appreciate the process of scientific development. By stressing the limitations and uses of scientific models, the authors show students how chemists think and work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05894b85d2f515d5d39a0eb72f474305281987cb","amp;dn":"Chemistry%3A+Media+Enhanced+Edition%2C+Seventh+Edition+%287Summits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05894b85d2f515d5d39a0eb72f474305281987cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,137,75,133,210,245,21,213,211,154,14,183,47,71,67,5,40,25,135,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
