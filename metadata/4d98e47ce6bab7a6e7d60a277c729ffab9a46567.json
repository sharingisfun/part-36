Pipeline is a compilation of The Question backup feature from Detective Comics. The Question #37 is part of the Blackest Night storyline.\n\nBoth are digital rips.\n\nCully Hamner's character design was well rationalised and made Renee Montoya a believable replacement for Vic Sage. Greg Rucka's characterizations of Tot and Renee fencing with philosophical quotes underscored the deeper philosophical underpinnings of their shared mission.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d98e47ce6bab7a6e7d60a277c729ffab9a46567","amp;dn":"Renee+Montoya+-+The+Question","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d98e47ce6bab7a6e7d60a277c729ffab9a46567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,152,228,124,230,186,183,166,231,214,10,39,124,114,159,250,185,164,101,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
