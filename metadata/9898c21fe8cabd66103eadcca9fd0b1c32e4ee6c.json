Feder.pdf\n\nArchaeology attempts to answer the question &quot;where do we come from?&quot; in the broadest sense possible; as a result, it is a highly interesting topic for all mankind. When did human beings first walk the earth? How did civilization develop? What compelled our human ancestors to build things like the pyramids, the Great Sphinx, or Monk's Mound?\n\nThis book presents the widely unknown scientific facts behind the most popular and enthralling &quot;mysteries&quot; of our world from an expert archaeological perspectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€and lays out the information and research in a manner that is approachable, engaging, and entertaining for any reader. Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum contains detailed and highly descriptive definitions forÃ¢â‚¬â€and explanations ofÃ¢â‚¬â€terms related to extraordinary claims about human antiquity and its study. Some of the terms in this extensive list of topics relate to archaeological hoaxes. Many of the entries relate to dubious interpretations of the human past; some of the terms relate to far-fetched arguments that actually have produced evidence in support of their veracity.\n\n292 pages\nPublisher: Greenwood (October 11, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0313379181\nISBN-13: 978-0313379185","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9898c21fe8cabd66103eadcca9fd0b1c32e4ee6c","amp;dn":"+Encyclopedia+of+Dubious+Archaeology+%282010%29+by+Kenneth+L.+Feder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9898c21fe8cabd66103eadcca9fd0b1c32e4ee6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,152,194,31,232,202,189,102,16,62,173,204,169,253,11,28,50,228,238,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
