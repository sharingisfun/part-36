A People's History has become a major success and was a runner-up in 1980 for the National Book Award. It has been adopted for reading in some high schools and colleges across the United States and has been frequently revised, with the most recent edition covering events through 2005. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the Prix des Amis du Monde Diplomatique for the French version of this book, Une histoire populaire des Etats-Unis. Over one million copies have been sold.\n\nIn a 1998 interview, Zinn said he had set ''quiet revolution'' as his goal for writing A People's History. ''Not a revolution in the classical sense of a seizure of power, but rather from people beginning to take power from within the institutions. In the workplace, the workers would take power to control the conditions of their lives.''\n\nThis abridged edition covers the events occurred in the 20th century.\n\n\nRunning Time: 8:45:23\n\n1  Harper Audio Presents\n2  The Black Revolt \n3  The United States Was Out In The World \n4  In Birmingham, In 1963 \n5  In The Summer Of 1966 \n6  The Killing Of King \n7  From 1964 To 1972 \n8  When Kennedy Took Office \n9  After The War \n10 Meanwhile, Just Across The Border \n11 Early In The War \n12 Students Protest Against The Rotc \n13 A Dispatch From Phu Bai \n14 In June Of 1964 \n15 Helen Keller Had Said \n16 Times Indeed Were Changing \n17 Perhaps The Most Profound Effect \n18 The Prisons In The United States \n19 The Official Report On The Attica Uprising \n20 It Was Thought That The Indians \n21 Indians Fought Back \n22 Indians Began To Do Something \n23 In The Akwesasne Community Itself \n24 In The Early 1990S \n25 Once He Was In Office \n26 Reagan Policies \n27 Fear Of Nuclear Accidents \n28 The Labor Movement \n29 After The Bombing Of Iraq Began \n30 In 1992, Limits Of Military Victory \n31 The Coming Revolt Of The Guards \n32 But Most Histories Understate Revolt \n33 The Critical Question In Our Time \n34 The Clinton Presidency \n35 Clinton's ''Law And Order'' Approach \n36 The New Government Policy \n37 The Bombing Of Baghdad \n38 Clinton's Foreign Economic Policy \n39 Clinton's Economic Program \n40 The Response Of The Government \n41 One Of The Greatest Union Victories \n42 The 2000 Election And The War On Terrorism \n43 Nine Months Into Bush's Presidency \n44 There Were Minor Voices Criticizing The War \n45 I Am Often Asked \n46 End\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9551d5285563d7f3e438519903eaa1685995192f","amp;dn":"Howard+Zinn+-+A+People%5C%27s+History+of+the+United+States+-+Abridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9551d5285563d7f3e438519903eaa1685995192f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,81,213,40,85,99,215,243,228,56,81,153,3,234,161,104,89,149,25,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
