It comes across as a &quot;mockumentry&quot; by Christopher Guest (Best In Show, Waiting For Guffman, etc.), but is it?? Whether you like the band Half Japanese or not doesn't really matter (as far as I'm concerned), this is a fun look at a band that you may not have heard of before. Don't forget to wait until after the credits, that's where you will find &quot;Live In Hell&quot;. This is a really cool performance by Half Japanese.
