Many artists through the years have recorded this song, but in my opinion this is the best version.\n256kbps.\nEnjoy!\nPlease seed!\nWrite a comment?\n/Jason","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ecf98a08623e7f345b8d75ec5365b13230d8b2e","amp;dn":"Ringo+Starr+-+Vertical+Man+-+256kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ecf98a08623e7f345b8d75ec5365b13230d8b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,207,152,160,134,35,231,243,69,184,215,94,197,54,91,19,35,13,139,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
