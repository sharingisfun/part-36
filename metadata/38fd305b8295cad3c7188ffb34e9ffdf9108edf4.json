They settled in their vast new homeland and generated new cultures as varied as snow and sand; the Arctic Eskimo, for example, the desert Navajo and the jungle Maya. This compact guide describes all the most important artistic developmentsâ€”the temples, pyramids, totem poles, frescoes, pottery and sculptureâ€”that distinguished these early cultures. Even today valuable discoveries are still being made, treasures uncovered, and many beautiful temples like those at Palenque lie unexplored in deep jungle. Enhanced by 98 full color illustrations, this book brings new life to the luxuriant world of these ancient civilizations and their savage but splendid peoples","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38fd305b8295cad3c7188ffb34e9ffdf9108edf4","amp;dn":"Precolumbian+Art+of+North+America+and+Mexico+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38fd305b8295cad3c7188ffb34e9ffdf9108edf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,253,48,91,130,149,202,211,199,24,143,251,52,233,255,223,145,8,237,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
