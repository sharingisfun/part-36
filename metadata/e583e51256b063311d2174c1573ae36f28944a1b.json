If you bear in mind that the Platters only did one Christmas session, then it probably doesn't matter which of these you pick up, although the sound on this 2004 edition is superb. The upbeat numbers fare best, with an energized version of &quot;Jingle Bells Jingle,&quot; an organ-led &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,&quot; and a spunky rendition of &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; being the obvious highlights. The group's manager, Buck Ram (who also produced the original album), has a couple of his own songs included here, &quot;Come Home for Christmas&quot; and &quot;Christmas Time,&quot; and both are competent but hardly memorable compositions. The arrangements on the album are interesting and frequently inventive, and the Platters, as always, sing wonderfully. One wishes, though, that it was just a little bit longer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e583e51256b063311d2174c1573ae36f28944a1b","amp;dn":"The+Platters+-+20th+Century+Masters%3A+Christmas+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e583e51256b063311d2174c1573ae36f28944a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,131,229,18,86,176,99,49,29,33,116,193,87,58,227,111,40,148,74,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
