In this high-concept show, the aerial cameras are used to give a bird's-eye view of sites usually inaccessible to the public, from the eerie fake villages constructed by the Ministry of Defence to practise invasions - tanks trundling down cardboard streets - to the homes of Russian billionaires, to Winston Churchill's bolthole in case the war went south. \r\nThe stories are fascinating and, while they could probably have been told without sending up a remote controlled quadcopter, the show is proof that modern technology can also help explore our past.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  1 \r\nTony Robinson presents the first of two programmes using drones to shoot aerial footage of areas of Britain that are off limits to the public. Among the locations featured is a village on Salisbury Plain that is not listed on any maps, and is used by the military for training. The drones record an exercise involving tanks storming the area. Other sites include the world's most advanced container port, a Second World War bunker, an abandoned airbase that once housed nuclear weapons, and an 18th-century mansion belonging to a Russian billionaire.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nPart two of two. Tony Robinson presents aerial footage of areas of Britain that are off limits to the public, including a shipyard in Scotland where aircraft carriers are built and a shipwreck on the Kent coast that is filled with explosives. Plus, a gated community with a dark past, James Dyson's top-secret research laboratory, and a platform in the sea inhabited by people who wish to become an independent nation.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/16/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Hidden-Britain-By-Drone-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3155 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 48mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.03 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/d4qzcj/hidden-britain-by-drone/episodeguide/series-1\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Rise%20of%20the%20Drones \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Secret%20Drone%20War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3480ccb45f0e380520d19e513af1578f4ae0400","amp;dn":"Ch4+Hidden+Britain+By+Drone+Series+1+1of2+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3480ccb45f0e380520d19e513af1578f4ae0400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,72,12,203,69,240,227,128,82,13,25,229,19,175,21,120,244,174,4,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
