As he did on his previous two solo albums, Hawkins pays considerable homage the Davis canon here, with achingly good results on &quot;I Belong to the Band&quot; (sung by guest vocalist Maria Muldaur) and a 12-string rendition of &quot;Crucifixion&quot; into which Hawkins also weaves the melody of &quot;Jesus Gonna Make Up My Dying Bed.&quot; But whereas 1996's Blues Advice presented Hawkins in more of a revivalist mode, Bluesified has him stretching out, experimenting with musical roots ranging from prewar jazz to country to African folk songs. In the end, Hawkins still puts on a formidable ragtime guitar clinic -- but he's obviously got a lot on his mind besides the blues.
