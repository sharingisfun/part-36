She is on a widely publicized tour of several European capitals, including Rome. One night, she rebels against the strenuous demands of her official duties, where every minute of her time is scheduled. Her doctor gives her a sedative in order to help her sleep, but she secretly leaves her country\\\\\\&amp;#039;s embassy and goes out alone to experience Rome.\n\nThe injection eventually takes effect and she falls asleep on a public bench where Joe Bradley (Peck), an expatriate American reporter, meets her, but does not recognize her. He offers her money so that she can take a taxi home, but \\\\\\&quot;Anya Smith,\\\\\\&quot; as she calls herself, refuses to disclose where that is, saying that she should be taken to the Colosseum. Joe finally decides, for safety\\\\\\&amp;#039;s sake, to let her spend the night in his apartment. He is amused by her regal manner, but less so when she appropriates his bed, leaving him the uncomfortable couch. The next morning, unable to rouse her, he goes to work.\n\n   continue---------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday_(1953_film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday_(1953_film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed for at least 24hrs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bbb78727de126809e5b7f5ab926598e9b3fa518","amp;dn":"Roman+Holiday+%281953%29BW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bbb78727de126809e5b7f5ab926598e9b3fa518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,187,120,114,125,225,38,128,158,91,127,90,185,38,89,142,155,63,165,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
