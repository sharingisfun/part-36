The first one, which will be released on October 31, and then the band will go out on the road; West Coast tour, then play Loud Park festival in Japan as well as visit a few other Asian cities before heading to Europe for a couple weeks.\nThen it's back to the States and we will finish up before Christmas, and we were mixing the second disc for 2013&quot;.\nTooth and Nail were forced to change their name to T&amp;N because of legal reasons. The band stated; Ã¢â‚¬Å“We cannot keep [the name] as Tooth And Nail as there is a label that has it trademarked.
