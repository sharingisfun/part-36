This is all very well. It is when machines claimed to be lie detectors appear in the context of criminal investigations or security applications that we need to be concerned. In the present paper we will describe two types of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdeceptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstress detectors&quot; (euphemisms to refer to what quite clearly is known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlie detectorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Both types of detection are claimed to be based on voice analysis but we found no scientific evidence to support the manufacturersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ claims. Indeed, our review of scientific studies will show that these machines perform at chance level when tested for reliability. Given such results and the absence of scientific support for the underlying principles it is justified to view the use of these machines as charlatanry and we argue that there are serious ethical and security reasons to demand that responsible authorities and institutions should not get involved in such practices.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b2f2b445a0fb8281563e92f274c4b1169763f5","amp;dn":"Charlantry+in+forensic+speech+science%3A+A+problem+to+be+taken+ser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b2f2b445a0fb8281563e92f274c4b1169763f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,178,242,180,69,160,251,130,129,86,62,146,242,116,196,177,22,151,99,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
