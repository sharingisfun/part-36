And yet without them, most organizations couldnt function. ISO 9001 and other quality management systems place great emphasis on documents, and for good reason. Documents arent individual, stand-alone elements of the management process. Theyre interrelated, formatted in different media, and controlled by various and distinct functions. Keeping critical information current and in the right hands requires more than just signing off on procedures. Document control is essential, but where should you begin?\n\nInside youll find clear explanations about the document control process as well as practical solutions for creating, organizing, and maintaining documents, including:\nA discussion of different kinds of documents, including electronic media and QMS requirements\nIdentifying and defining responsibility\nUnderstanding the relationship between documents and records\nTips for document writers\nManaging and maintaining documents\nIssues of accessibility\nHandling revisions and deviations\nWriting document control procedures\n\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology.
