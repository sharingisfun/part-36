When the checkbox is selected, ThinApp checks if the Horizon agent is installed natively on the client and is running. If the Horizon agent is found, the ThinApp package reports to the Horizon agent so that it can be controlled by Horizon Application Manager.\nHorizon Application Manager entitlement allows the delivery of ThinApp packaged applications to specified users and groups. The Horizon agent authorizes a ThinApp package to open, based on entitlements.\nThinApp packages are registered by Horizon Application Manager and delivered to end points.\nThe administrator can track usage of ThinApp packages by using Horizon Application Manager monitoring and reporting.\nThe administrator can configure an Organizational URL for end points missing the Horizon agent.\n\nThe ThinApp 4.7 release resolves these issues:\n\nAn error message is displayed in the console when you use non-ASCII characters in application installer subdirectory names.
