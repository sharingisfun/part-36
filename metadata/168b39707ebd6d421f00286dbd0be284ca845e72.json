The setting is 1880s London, and they've written a musical called &quot;The Princess and the Plumber&quot;, which they plan to open on Christmas Eve. Cavis thinks the production will &quot;teach London how to love&quot;. But children at nearby St. Bart's Church are planning a nativity play for the same evening, and they plan to feature the Star of Christmas, a religious artifact unseen by the public for decades. The London Post Gazette writes a front-page story about the nativity play and the Star, and Cavis and Millward hatch a plan to make their musical better than the children's play. In the end, they learn about the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nDirector:Tim Hodge\nWriter:Phil Vischer\nStars:Dan Anderson, Matthew Hodge and Tim Hodge ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168b39707ebd6d421f00286dbd0be284ca845e72","amp;dn":"2002.VeggieTales.The.Star.of.Christmas.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168b39707ebd6d421f00286dbd0be284ca845e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,139,57,112,126,189,109,66,31,0,40,109,189,11,226,132,202,132,94,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
