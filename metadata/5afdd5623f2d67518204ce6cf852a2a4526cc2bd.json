Her charges' older brother, Leo Hathaway, is thoroughly exasperating. Cat can hardly believe that their constant arguing could mask a mutual attraction. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful responseÃ¢â‚¬â€and even more so when Leo proposes a dangerous liaison.\n\nShe is not at all what she seems...\n\nLeo must marry and produce an heir within a year to save his family home. Catherine's respectable demeanor hides a secret that would utterly destroy her. But to Leo, Cat is intriguing and infernally tempting, even to a man resolved never to love again. The danger Cat tried to outrun is about to separate them foreverÃ¢â‚¬â€unless two wary lovers can find a way to banish the shadows and give in to their desires..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5afdd5623f2d67518204ce6cf852a2a4526cc2bd","amp;dn":"Lisa+Kleypas+-+Married+by+Morning+%28Hathaways++Series+4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5afdd5623f2d67518204ce6cf852a2a4526cc2bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,253,213,98,63,45,103,81,130,4,206,108,248,82,162,164,82,108,194,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
