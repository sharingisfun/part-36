It is a mediocre game. ENJOY! \n\n\nSyndicate (initially called Project RedLime) is a science fiction game by Starbreeze Studios, released on February 21, 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It is a reboot of the Syndicate series developed by Bullfrog Productions, changing the genre from a tactical shooter to an FPS.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5fcadce07f3207451862dd0672c00c19992420","amp;dn":"Syndicate+100%25+Complete+Save+Game+File+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5fcadce07f3207451862dd0672c00c19992420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,95,202,220,224,127,50,7,69,24,98,221,6,114,192,12,25,153,36,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
