Part one is this album, subtitled Chapter One: Gens De Couleur Libres\r\nwhich is a fascinating mix of genres, ideas and song. There is the raw toned\r\ntenor saxophone that she has developed a unique tone on in instrumental pieces\r\nlike the opening &quot;Rise,&quot; which move through free and intense areas of\r\nexploration providing an opening into the story. Roberts also sings quite well\r\non the album, but the centerpiece is her haunting narration of a slave auction\r\non â€œLibation For Mr. Brown: Bid â€˜em Inâ€ where she throws her heart and soul\r\ninto the scorn and shame of American slavery. Itâ€™s an unforgettable narrative,\r\nakin to Abbey Lincolnâ€™s work with Max Roach on songs like â€œDrivaâ€™ Man.â€ This is\r\none of the most unique musical experiences to be released in 2011, and really\r\nsucceeds where well meaning but overly bloated efforts like Wynton Marsalisâ€™\r\nepic Blood on the Fields have faltered. By breaking her narrative down into\r\ndiscreet parts, she is developing a project akin to the late clarinetist John\r\nCarterâ€™s Roots and Folklore series of albums, which examined the\r\nAfrican-American experience through music. Part history lesson, part protest\r\nalbum, and all jazz in its soul and conception, this is a thoughtful and\r\nvaluable project that deserves much attention.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Thom Jurek \nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/coin-coin-chapter-one-gens-de-couleur-libre-mw0002125075\r\n\r\nBy Guy Peters \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2011/12/matana-roberts-coin-coin-chapter-one.html\r\n\r\nBy Martin Longley \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/89cg\r\n\r\nBy Eric Dawson \nhttp://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/matana-roberts-coin-coin-chapter-one-gens-de-couleur-libres\r\n\r\nBy Richard Elliott \nhttp://www.popmatters.com/review/145463-matana-roberts-coin-coin-chapter-one-gens-de-couleur-libres/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:545cdcfa7d9c6348ac4fadcf1a53a5ea8f8c0bee","amp;dn":"Matana+Roberts+-+Coin+Coin+One%3A+Gens+De+Couleur+Libres+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"545cdcfa7d9c6348ac4fadcf1a53a5ea8f8c0bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,92,220,250,125,156,99,72,172,79,173,207,26,83,165,234,143,140,11,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
