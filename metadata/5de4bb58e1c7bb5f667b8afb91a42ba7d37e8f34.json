From the mania of Victorian collectors to the enthusiasm of modern photographers, this family of flowering plants has a strange and exotic appeal. Many orchids are beautiful, and some are rare. This well illustrated orchid guide covers the identification, biology and conservation of British and Irish orchids. Until recently, the whereabouts of the rarer species was shrouded in secrecy, making publication of any details ethically impossible. In the last few years, however, these veils have been lifted and it is now possible to publish locations for all but one or two species. For the first time, this book includes a detailed site guide, covering the best places to see orchids in Britain. &quot;A model field guide: good, large photographs that are actually rather gorgeous; a clear text that tells you how to identify the plant using the English language rather than &quot;botanicalese&quot;; useful diagrams of those spectacular flower parts; and a really comprehensive section on geographical range and subspecies.&quot; The Daily Telegraph \n\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 480 pages\n# Publisher: A &amp; C Black Publishers Ltd; 2nd Revised edition edition (15 April 2009)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 1408105713\n# ISBN-13: 978-1408105719","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de4bb58e1c7bb5f667b8afb91a42ba7d37e8f34","amp;dn":"Orchids+of+Britain+and+Ireland+-+A+Field+and+Site+Guide+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de4bb58e1c7bb5f667b8afb91a42ba7d37e8f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,228,187,88,225,199,187,95,102,123,138,251,145,164,43,167,211,126,143,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
