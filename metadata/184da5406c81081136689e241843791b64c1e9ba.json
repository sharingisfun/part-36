Some of AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ singles only sold a few hundred copies, but as he explained, &quot;It kept my name out there. As long as I had a record out that got played on the radio once in a while or the jukeboxes, I could work off that. When the records stop coming, so does the work.&quot;[1] Unexpectedly, Adams caught a break in 1968 when he and Wardell Quezergue teamed up to revive &quot;Release Me&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€which had earlier been a hit for Esther Phillips and Engelbert Humperdinck. The Watch single exploded in New Orleans and attracted several national labels interested in leasing it. Eventually, Shelby Singleton's Nashville-based SSS label purchased the master, and Adams' contract.[1] &quot;Release Me&quot; climbed to Number 34 on the pop charts, and his subsequent sessions were assigned to Music City. AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ career flourished when he was teamed with the transplanted Shreveport songwriting team of Margaret Lewis and Myrna Smith.[1] &quot;Reconsider Me&quot; (Number 28) and &quot;I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Be All Bad&quot; (Number 45)Ã¢â‚¬â€&quot;the veritable blueprints for country soul&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€followed &quot;Release Me&quot; in the pop charts. SSS issued Heart &amp; Soul, a collection of his recordings to that point, in 1969 as a reaction to the success of his singles. The cover photo pictures Adams standing on the top of a Tennessee mountain on a particularly frigid day, &quot;where the temperature never got above 20 degrees!&quot;[1]\n\nDespite the success of his SSS records, AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ life didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change all that much. &quot;I had a few good paydays, and I bought a new car in 1970, but things werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all that different,&quot; claimed Adams. &quot;It got to be a hassle out on the road for so long. You'd work on a promise for three nights and the promoter would disappear with the money. That happened to me in Athens, Georgia and I got stranded. Pretty much I stuck with my old routine.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:184da5406c81081136689e241843791b64c1e9ba","amp;dn":"Johnny+Adams+-+Heart+%26amp%3B+Soul+%281969%29+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"184da5406c81081136689e241843791b64c1e9ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,77,165,64,108,129,8,17,54,104,158,36,24,67,121,27,100,193,233,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
