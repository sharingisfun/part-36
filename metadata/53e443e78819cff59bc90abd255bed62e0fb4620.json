This ministry makes the connection between Torah and New Testament. When you study the Hebrew roots of the Bible-much will be revealed to you.\n\n\nThe Spring Feasts were in anticipation of Yeshua's 1st coming. The Fall Feasts are in anticipation of Yeshua's 2nd coming in the near future.\n\n\nThere were Jews that missed the signs of Yeshua's 1st coming.Remember,it was not until Judah repented that Joseph revealed himself. It will not be until the Jews seek Yeshua that Yeshua will reveal himself.In their affliction-they will repent.I'm afraid a lot of Christians will miss the signs of Yeshua's 2nd coming. A lot think the Feasts of the Lord do not apply to Christians.We will find out.\n\n\nMost of the world is turning against Israel. War is on the horizon.\nI will stand with my God and stand with the Jews.The &quot;Super Bowl&quot; of all history is approaching fast.Put me in coach.I want to serve the Lord!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e443e78819cff59bc90abd255bed62e0fb4620","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Bible+revealed+to+those+that+search+the+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e443e78819cff59bc90abd255bed62e0fb4620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,228,67,231,136,25,207,245,155,201,10,189,37,91,237,98,224,251,70,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
