In this paper we \ndemonstrate that a sufficiently advanced civilization could, in principal, \nmanipulate the radius of the extra dimension to locally adjust the value of the \ncosmological constant. This adjustment could be tuned to generate an \nexpansion/contraction of spacetime around a spacecraft creating an exotic form of \nfield-propulsion. Due to the fact that spacetime expansion itself is not \nrestricted by relativity, a faster-than-light &amp;#039;warp drive&amp;#039; could be created. \nCalculations of the energy requirements of such a drive are performed and an \n&amp;#039;ultimate&amp;#039; speed limit, based on the Planckian limits on the size of the extra \ndimensions is found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0360d0e07eb956fceddf4ed8276ba6fa02cd9f7a","amp;dn":"Warp+Drive%3A+A+New+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0360d0e07eb956fceddf4ed8276ba6fa02cd9f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,96,208,224,126,185,86,252,237,223,78,216,39,107,166,250,2,205,159,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
