Possessing strength and agility and a vampire doomed to drink the blood of the living and the fear of sunlight, the Rhine would side with the forces of good in the game BloodRayne 2.\n\nLast time we met with the Rhine in the distant 1935, at a time when dampirsha destroyed the Nazi scientists who want to global power . Her father, Kagan, chief ally of the Nazis, was killed at the end of the Second World War. Having missed the chance to end it himself, Rein spent the next 60 years, hunting and killing his children, her brothers and sisters. The survivors banded together and founded the Cult of Kagan, pledging to fulfill his will. This marked a new era of vampire rule, in which people were given the role of livestock for sucking the blood of predators. In a short time created a cult of the Shroud, the mysterious substance that, once in the atmosphere, will make the deadly sun rays harmless to vampires. Now only the Rhine stands between an unsuspecting humanity and a horrifying vampire dawn.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.ag.ru/ag/i/0.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7826cfc761b68e75d956c6829f6736c1fdc8464a","amp;dn":"BloodRayne+Dilougy++Repack+By+R.G+Catalyst+NASWARI%2BZOHAIB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7826cfc761b68e75d956c6829f6736c1fdc8464a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,38,207,199,97,182,142,117,217,86,198,130,159,103,54,193,253,200,70,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
