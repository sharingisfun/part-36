False Positive: Software - games... have cracks-keygens-patches.\nThey are doing something to give you the program for free.\nThere is no danger to your pc\n\n============================================\nPatch #4 Changelog\n============================================\n\nAdded a new intro sequence\nWhat exactly happened to you before you woke up in the Shelter? Time to find out!\n\nChanged night-time behavior:\nYou no longer lose the game for staying out past midnight. Instead, nighttime combat penalties are applied after 8 p.m.; staying out past midnight causes the fatigue status; and staying out past 3 a.m. now incurs a -50 morale hit, 50% health loss to all members of the party, and kicks you back to the Shelter. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using horses, they become exhausted and unusable for a couple of days, and if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using the car, it breaks and you need to repair it again. (In other words, get your butt back to the Shelter before 3 a.m.!)\n\nAdded a Recycler Upgrade:\nBy popular request, you can now build the Recycler Upgrade to break weapons and armor down into parts. This will most likely need balancing work, so make sure to share your feedback with us on the boards and forums.\n\nAdjusted Healing:\nBased on feedback from the community, the Infirmary is no longer the only way to recover lost maximum HP. Lost max HP now slowly heals naturally with rest in the Shelter at the rate of 1 per hour. Treatment in the Infirmary still offers a much quicker way to get back on your feet, but it is no longer the only way.\n\nPerformed major combat balance pass:\nIncluding armor, weapons, shields, enemies, and enemy chance to crit.\n\nUpdated level visuals:\nWe improved visuals in over 70 levels.\n\nUpdated level loot, combat, and events:\nA number of levels received combat and loot passes, and we even added some more random events.\n\nImplemented and fixed perk effects:\nNew perk effects for Animal Magnetism, Pharmacist, and Gardener were added, and some existing bugged perks were fixed.\n\n\nUpdated and added icons, portraits, and models\n\nAdded new rare melee weapons and minibosses on multiple maps\n\nAdded more Lore items to various enemies:\nNote: thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a known bug with the Lore system right now that will be resolved in the next patch.\n\nAdded ability to obtain cats for the Shelter\n\nAdded new Crisis Events\n\nAdded ally deaths from antibiotic shortages:\nKnown issue: camera data isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in yet, so consider these WIP for now.\n\nAdded mood bonuses and penalties\n\nChanged fence job behavior and text:\nWe changed the title and description text on the stone-reinforced fence job to more correctly reflect the nature of the upgrade.\n\nFixed, added, and updated dialogues\n\nAdded Credits button to options menu\n\nAdded wounded status icon\n\nAdded better handling of location detection on area map\n\nAdded additional infirmary polish:\nCharacters teleport to the infirmary when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re injured and even lie down in the beds.\n\nAdjusted prone AP penalty\n\nAdded requirement of rotten fruit to antibiotics manufacturing\n\nAdded buff status effects Ã¢â‚¬Å“AimedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“PumpedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAdded new faction combat barks\n\nAdded new Ã¢â‚¬Ëœselect allÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ buttons in the shelter\n\nAdjusted travel speed of horses\n\nThere are lots of other smaller tweaks, additions, and improvements that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stumble across as you go, but that should cover most of it :) Watch out for our next patch, which should be equally impressive and satisfy even more popular community requests.\n\nFrom all of us here at DoubleBear, Happy Halloween!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ea725c2502fd48acf6c500c661240039c1159b","amp;dn":"Dead+State+v+0.8.1.442","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ea725c2502fd48acf6c500c661240039c1159b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,234,114,92,37,2,253,72,172,246,197,0,198,97,36,0,57,193,21,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
