Tom Beaufoy and Pat Pardy first combined skills in 1998 and were quickly identified as a quality DJ/Producer duo by Adam Freeland who signed them to his Marine Parade label. Since then each of their releases has distinguished Evil 9 as innovators who refuse to blend into the scene. Deriving their musical flavour from multiple influences - hip hop, punk, deep house, garage rock, techno and kraut rock - they create an original and minimal sound packed with emotive ability. Evil 9's punk rock DIY attitude is epitomised in their remix of ILS' 'Music' wich stirred the breaks scene - irritating purists, exciting the open minded and inciting the masses to jump and pogo. Recent collaborations have included work with Aesop Rock (DEFJUX) and Juice Aleem (New Flesh).           \n                    please seed when completed \n                                comments appreciated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46b1425441f1c52bbe3ee1883a0e0b8328665f4","amp;dn":"Fabriclive+28+evil+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46b1425441f1c52bbe3ee1883a0e0b8328665f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,107,20,37,68,31,28,82,187,227,238,24,131,160,224,184,50,134,101,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
