The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nToday on this live Sunday edition, guest hosts and Infowars crew members Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew take on the open hypocrisy of Western forces admittedly allying with, aiding, arming and otherwise cheering on al Qaeda in the attempt to topple Assad's regime in Syria, while destabilizing Iran and other opponents in the region. \n\nThen, Alex Jones joins by phone with breaking news about attempts to bring martial law to Texas, and further merge military and police in violation of Posse Comitatus, this time against the supposed threat of IEDs and roadside bombs in the homeland. It's all part of the Orwellian attempt to flip the script on terrorism and occupy America, demonizing its patriots as domestic terrorists and hardening the total takeover. \n\nOn the Edge host Max Keiser and Alex also discuss the myriad of issues eroding away our remaining civil liberties -- from rain water collection, to Monsanto and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the rights of the people are being transferred to offshore, globalist corporate interests bent on total domination.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a2291c3ac2a74e7c10c46c7279690abcd8c605","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+Aug+05+SU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1a2291c3ac2a74e7c10c46c7279690abcd8c605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,162,41,28,58,194,167,78,124,16,196,108,114,121,105,10,188,216,198,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
