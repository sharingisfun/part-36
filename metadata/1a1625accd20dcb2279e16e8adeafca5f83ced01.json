More Storms CominÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nWith the power-riffs of a blues-rock band and the thick, pop sensibility of say, John Mellencamp, Mark Selby zeros-in on the essence of timeless roots rock. &quot;Don't You Throw That Mojo on Me,&quot; has an intro that effectively weds modern, almost alternative studio devices with traditional acoustic blues then rolls along with New Orleans-style piano and a mean slide lead. Choogling through pop tunes (&quot;She's Like Mercury&quot;) and the final, title song (which makes up for any lack of subtlety throughout), Selby has fashioned an atypically appealing modern blues-rock sound, easily filed between Kenny Wayne Shepherd and the Black Crowes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1625accd20dcb2279e16e8adeafca5f83ced01","amp;dn":"Mark+Selby+-+More+Storms+Comin%27+%5B2000%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1625accd20dcb2279e16e8adeafca5f83ced01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,22,37,172,205,32,220,178,39,158,22,232,173,234,252,165,248,60,237,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
