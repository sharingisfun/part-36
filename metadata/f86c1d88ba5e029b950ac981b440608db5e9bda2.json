And, with an Audubon-influenced insect lithograph reminiscent of those large, antique nature books used to showcase a speciesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ raw perfection, (Tropic) is a perfect example of folk music. An Englishman turned Californian, Pickering PickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music is everything you would expect from a songwriter who has made this kind of transition Ã¢â‚¬â€ warm, serene, poetic, and organic. Like his previous albums, listening to (Tropic) is a spiritual experience. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not spiritual in a religious sense, but it does affect and stir the spirit. His gentle performance and restraint allows you to meditate and focus on what is important Ã¢â‚¬â€ the eloquent lyrics, exquisite fingerpicking, and beautiful vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€ while becoming one with the songs. Pickering Pick is a rare talent who has the ability to create gorgeous, minimal music that makes you long for his longings and dream his dreams completely absorbing you into his words and world.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86c1d88ba5e029b950ac981b440608db5e9bda2","amp;dn":"Pickering+Pick+-+%28Tropic%29+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86c1d88ba5e029b950ac981b440608db5e9bda2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,108,29,136,186,94,2,155,149,10,201,129,180,64,96,141,181,233,189,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
