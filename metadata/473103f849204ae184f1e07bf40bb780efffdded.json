In addition to revising and updating existing articles, the new Encyclopedia of Industrial Biotechnology has been greatly expanded to cover important areas of pharmaceutical and biologics bioprocess technology, including:\r\nProduction of vaccines\r\nBiopharmaceuticals and methods for manufacturing biomaterials\r\nBiofabrication for the production of microfluidics\r\nTissue engineering\r\nBiosensors\r\nBioelectronics\r\nBioarrays \r\nBio-nanotechnology\r\nIDEAL STARTING POINT FOR ANY RESEARCH PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe Encyclopedia of Industrial Biotechnology was published in order to help readers make sense of the vast amounts of information that have been published around the world across a broad array of ournals, books, and websites. With its comprehensive coverage, Encyclopedia of Industrial Biotechnology is the ideal starting point for research projects involving any aspect of industrial biological processes, including fermentation, biocatalysis, bioseparation, and biofabrication.\r\n\r\nReview\r\nâ€œThis seven-volume, 4,900-page reference resource for industrial biotechnology is a tour de force â€¦ The nearly 700 contributing authors deliver well-referenced, quality monographs covering both broad and narrow topics in industrial biology, biochemistry, engineering, marketing, microbiology, and processing.â€ (Choice, 1 November 2010)\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nDr. Michael C. Flickinger is the Associate Director for Academic Programs of the Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) and a Professor of Microbiology and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at North Carolina State University, Raleigh. \r\nFrom 1985 to 1992 Dr. Flickinger was Director of the University of Minnesota's Institute for Advanced Studies in Biological Process Technology (BPTI), which was later renamed the Biotechnology Institute (BTI), and a Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul. Prior to coming to Minnesota Dr. Flickinger was Director of the Fermentation Program at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland.\r\nDr. Flickinger received his academic training at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He graduated with honors earning a B.S. degree in microbial biochemistry in 1973. He then moved to the School of Pharmacy for his graduate work and received M.S. (1975) and Ph.D. degrees (1977) in pharmaceutical biochemistry. He did his postdoctoral work at the Laboratory for Renewable Resources Engineering (LORRE) in the School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\r\nHe is Co-Editor of the Encyclopedia of Bioprocess Technology: Fermentation, Biocatalysis and Bioseparation (Wiley, 1999)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:473103f849204ae184f1e07bf40bb780efffdded","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Industrial+Biotechnology+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"473103f849204ae184f1e07bf40bb780efffdded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,49,3,248,73,32,74,225,132,241,224,123,244,11,183,128,239,255,221,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
