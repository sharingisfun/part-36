During the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Logan rescues an officer named Yashida and shields him from the blast.\n\nIn the present day, Logan lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by hallucinations of Jean Grey, whom he was forced to kill in X-Men: The Last Stand. He is located by Yukio, a mutant with the precognitive ability to foresee people's deaths, on-behalf of Yashida, now the CEO of a technology corporation. Yashida, who is dying of cancer, wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt.\n\nIn Tokyo, Logan meets Yashida's son, Shingen, and granddaughter, Mariko. There, Yashida offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body, thus saving Yashida's life and alleviating Logan of his immortality, which Logan views as a curse. Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day. That night, Yashida's doctor Viper introduces something into Logan's body, but Logan dismisses it as a dream.\n\nThe next morning, Logan is informed that Yashida has died. At the funeral, Yakuza gangsters attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan and Mariko escape together into the urban sprawl of Tokyo. Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal as quickly as they should. After fighting off more Yakuza on a bullet train, Logan and Mariko hide in a local love hotel. Meanwhile, Yashida's bodyguard Kenuichio Harada meets with Viper who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands he find Logan and Mariko.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9361848f6ffa15a785e8e6599f3618c95ee747bb","amp;dn":"The+Wolverine+2013+TSCamRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9361848f6ffa15a785e8e6599f3618c95ee747bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,97,132,143,111,250,21,167,133,232,230,89,159,54,24,201,94,231,71,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
