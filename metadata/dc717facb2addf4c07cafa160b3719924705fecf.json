It was given to me by a coworker In original CD and I rip it on MP3 but eventually I lost the original CD somehow and I have no idea who mix it or who the artist is. But I can tell you for sure that It is indeed very good and Is one that I listened dozens of times. If you like Trance you won't be disappointed. \n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 Airwave\n02 Celebrate Our Love\n03 The Power Of Love\n04 Secret Garden\n05 7 Colours\n06 Atmosphere\n07 Heart Of Asia\n08 Chi Mai\n09 Nino Del Sol\n10 Tenshi\n11 Red Sun Rising\n12 Sandstorm\n13 Synaesthesia\n14 Panty Hose\n15 Pulsar\n16 House Of Pain\n17 Noise\n18 Bad Ass\n19 Oye Comova\n\nIf Anyone out there Knows the real name of this album or the artist please leave it in the comments.
