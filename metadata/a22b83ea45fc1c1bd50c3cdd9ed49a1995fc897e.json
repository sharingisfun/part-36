It's time to soldier up: the final battle for Keyhouse is about to begin.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22b83ea45fc1c1bd50c3cdd9ed49a1995fc897e","amp;dn":"Locke+%26amp%3B+Key+-+Omega+02+%28of+07%29+%282012%29+%282+covers+-+c2c+%26amp%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22b83ea45fc1c1bd50c3cdd9ed49a1995fc897e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,43,131,234,69,252,28,27,213,12,60,221,158,212,154,25,149,252,137,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
