Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket). -Never before seen footage gives you, the viewer, a unique look at what really happens on the set! Situation Normal, All Fucked Up! When things go wrong the Gunny sounds off loud and clear - and it ain't pretty! This DVD is loaded with an hour of uncensored foul-ups, blunders and mishaps on the set of MAIL CALL - you are NEVER gonna see this stuff on television, that's for sure! It happens in the military, and it happens on MAIL CALL - the hit television series from THE HISTORY CHANNELÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®.\n  \nNot everything we plan for on MAIL CALL happens the way we want it to. And when things go wrong the Gunny sounds off loud and clear - and it ain't pretty! If you're a hardcore MAIL CALL fan ready for full-caliber Gunny, then lock and load the &quot;x-tra salty&quot; version for full-bore Gunny! Or, if you'd rather watch something that the whole family can enjoy, choose the &quot;family friendly&quot; version to experience Gunny with the rough language bleeped out. Either way, it's a MAIL CALL experience you'll never forget! *Parental Advisory: The &quot;X-tra Salty&quot; version of this DVD is not suitable for children. \n\nUPLOADER'S NOTE - When ripping this, it wasn't possible to tell which audio track was the uncensored version, and which one was the bleeped version. The uncensored version gets old pretty quick, while the bleep noises on THIS version are actually kinda funny. If you want the uncensored version, there are a few torrents of it about, just search google.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729692bb1e4dbdf407ebaa0f6387c72c28a327dc","amp;dn":"Mail+Call+-+S.N.A.F.U.+%28Bloopers%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729692bb1e4dbdf407ebaa0f6387c72c28a327dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,150,146,187,30,77,189,244,7,235,170,15,99,135,199,44,40,163,39,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
