It is also to increase the feeling of exhaling and inhaling.  Also this set of Taichi is the most fundamental demonstration of Taichi qigong.  The higher the standard is, the less it would show.\n\nThis means &amp;#039;not showing off on purpose&amp;#039;.  So we wish every learner who are interested increase the knowledge through genuine rigorous practice.  Otherwise, it will result in a sick &amp;#039;qi&amp;#039; or even dizzness and imbalance.&quot;\n\nSpecific---\n\nVideo begins with an introduction to the Chen family style of Taichi\n- In Chinese, w/Chinese Subtitles\n- Followed by English w/ English Subtitles\n\nAt approximately 8m50s, the actual lesson begins...\n-Lesson is in Chinese and English\n-As is typical for this type of video, the moves are shown, then shown again\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the files:\n-Nothing fancy:  VCD -&gt; IsoBuster -&gt; .mpg\n-video is 36m 00s long\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is actually a pretty good video, IMHO\n\nSo...  If you like it...\n\nLearn it, live it, know it.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d99e1e42f60cf3d1e05ed245a673edfd90d35e","amp;dn":"%5BChinese+Language%5D%5BMartial+Arts%5D+Chen+Style+Taichi+Qigong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d99e1e42f60cf3d1e05ed245a673edfd90d35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,217,158,30,66,246,12,243,209,224,94,210,69,166,115,237,253,144,211,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
