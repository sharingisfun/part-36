Yes, the word is overused, but here it really applies. Enjoy listening to a unique performer at the very top of his game - accompanied by Brasilian musicians from the top drawer -&quot;Seduzir&quot; contains some arrangements so wrenching and achingly beautiful you'd think they were made in heaven... Faltando Um Padaco I consider to be a masterpiece. One of the two copies I purchased was given as a wedding gift to a couple just married this past weekend. Whether you are in love now or recently had a break-up or experienced a dump-fest, this record will not make you feel cornier and more left out. This music uplifts one as a member of the human race, even if you have little or no idea of the Portuguese language lyrics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20ffba67388b97e1e2fd06367f99202fc1c29bac","amp;dn":"Djavan-Seduzir%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20ffba67388b97e1e2fd06367f99202fc1c29bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,255,186,103,56,139,151,225,226,253,6,54,127,153,32,47,193,194,155,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
