You can read the description of the game in the previous newspost.

The countrys benevolentmonarch is nowhere to be found, and an usurper named Lord Blackthorn hasclaimed the throne! Its your duty as the embodiment of the EightVirtues to make all wrongs right and recover the world of Britannia fromthe paws of Blackthorn and his three evil Shadowlords! Thisinstallation of the Ultima series expands on the world of Ultima 4 in anumber of ways: towns are larger, have more unique buildings, and NPCinteraction has evolved. With enhanced dialogues, diverse conversationtopics, and a diverse array of characters, Ultima V shows that LordBritish kept raising the bar for games looking to call themselves anRPG.?

Delve intothe world of Britannia and save its inhabitants &amp; moral codex!\n\nUltima6: The False Prophet starts out with a bang!

Ultima 6 is a one of akind game which, without over imposing it on the player, tells a storyof the evil of human prejudice and ignorance.
