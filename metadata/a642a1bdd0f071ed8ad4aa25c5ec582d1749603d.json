This time the organizing principle is the remarkable ingenuity shown by hard-working scientists, ingenuity that sometimes verges on, well, craziness. Think of this book as a science edition of the Darwin Awards, only (mostly) not so fatal: these are stories of hands-on research performed by dedicated, if often decidedly offbeat, individuals. Like the biologist who tried to use a remote-controlled miniature helicopter to capture freshly expelled whale snot; or the researchers who used models of turkeys to determine the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œminimum stimulus it takes to excite a male turkeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; or the physician who tried to measure the weight of a human using a dying patient and a wooden beam; or the Italian fellow who told police he could determine a suspectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guilt or innocence by examining his internal organs. A deeply fascinating and occasionally rib-tickling book.\n\n\n\n\nscanned with Kaspersky  + SuperAntiSpyware + Malwarebytes = Malware FREE\n\nENJOY\n       scuba-doo\n\n\nshare the wealth and seed, comments are more then welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a642a1bdd0f071ed8ad4aa25c5ec582d1749603d","amp;dn":"Do+Sparrows+Like+Bach+%28scuba-doo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a642a1bdd0f071ed8ad4aa25c5ec582d1749603d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,66,161,189,208,240,113,237,138,212,170,37,197,236,88,45,23,73,96,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
