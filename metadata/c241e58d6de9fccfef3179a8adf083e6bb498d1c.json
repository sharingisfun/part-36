Live streamed via his live.deadmau5.com site, Joel offered his paying fans 120 minutes of pure good music, free of top 40 beatport charters, Animals, and Levels. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re only into electronic music for the one note festival drops and the girls then this is not for you. But if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in it for the masterful transitions, the technical builds and never ending drop lacking progression, then this my friend is for you. Sit back, relax and enjoy deadmau5 at his very best!\n\n\n\n\n**TRACKLIST 1ST HOUR**\n\n1) ID - ID\n2) Lluis Ribalta - Belial\n3) Deadmau5 - Luxuria\n4) RAR - The Tool w/ Deadmau5 - Secondary Complications w/ Deadmau5 - Sometimes Things Get, Whatever\n5) ID - ID\n6) Whyt Noyz - In 95\n7) Carlo Ruetz - I'm F***ing Famous\n8) Pryda - Muranyi\n9) Theo Parrish - Falling Up (Carl Craig 2013 remaster)\n10) TG - Mr. Dry\n11) Audion - Noiser\n12) Joris Voorn - Decay\n13) Schneider TM - The Light 3000\n14) ID - IDÃ¯Â»Â¿\n\n\n\n\n&amp;*TRACKLIST 2ND HOUR**\n\n15) Max Cooper - Enveloped\n16) Deadmau5 - Petting Zoo (working title) w/ Deadmau5 - Glish (working title) w/ Deadmau5 feat.
