Young and new workers have a high risk for work-related injury compared with more experienced workers. Occupational safety and health training remains a fundamental element of hazard control in the workplace, and there is great potential to reduce these incidents through pre-employment training. Effective pre-employment training should include realistic environments and hands-on exercises. However, NIOSH recommends that actual employment in the electrical trades or any of the other construction trades be delayed until individuals reach the minimum age of 18.\n\nThis student manual is part of a safety and health curriculum for secondary and post-secondary electrical trades courses. The manual is designed to engage the learner in recognizing, evaluating, and controlling hazards associated with electrical work. It was developed through extensive research with vocational instructors, and we are grateful for their valuable contributions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87fc84869359914f63e7c1891c298f03a56c7c2","amp;dn":"Electrical+Safety+-+Safety+and+Health+for+Electrical+Trades+Stud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87fc84869359914f63e7c1891c298f03a56c7c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,127,200,72,105,53,153,20,246,62,124,24,145,194,152,240,58,86,199,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
