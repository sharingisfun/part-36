Maybe it's beause Cassandra touches me fathoms below the happy medium, and is born in my year, that her voice always brings me through tears to a place of calm. Moody Blue. We know how the sad story ends, but she's got the grit to retell it in a beguiling way, like an inner voice and honest companion, a conscience acknowledging pain with dignity. Not everybody's bag, but mine for sure. A requiem. It isn't honey; more like molasses. ~ Christophe M, Hawthorne\n\nCassandra Wilson - Closer to You: The Pop Side Tracks:\n01  Love is Blindness \n02  Time After Time \n03  Fragile \n04  Closer to You \n05  Last Train to Clarksville \n06  The Weight \n07  Tupelo Honey \n08  Harvest Moon \n09  I Can't Stand the Rain \n10  Lay Lady Lay \n11  Wichita Lineman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c963208d1d3d1c4f6841bade11d3e0893df099d","amp;dn":"Cassandra+Wilson+-+Closer+to+You+-+The+Pop+Side+%282009%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c963208d1d3d1c4f6841bade11d3e0893df099d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,150,50,8,209,211,209,196,246,132,27,173,225,29,62,8,147,223,9,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
