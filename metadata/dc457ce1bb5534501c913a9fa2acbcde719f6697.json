With a dynamic sound, they fall somewhere in the spectrum of Progressive Rock. After numerous changes in its line up, the group has grown to a five-piece from its original three members. ChronoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound is diverse, rich, and sophisticated.\n\nA few of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influences include Porcupine Tree, The Flashbulb, A Perfect Circle, Jimi Hendrix, Tool, NIN, Mastodon, Muse, Aphex Twin, and Pendulum.\n\nDrawing from an eclectic set of influences and experience, Chrono moves through chaotic harmonies, driving vocals, and wistful melodies to create its own world for the listener. Dynamic, emotive, and energized, the band reflects the creative drive to experience things fully and honestly.\n\nAt the heart of the band, co-founders and long-time friends Zac Pirnat and Jeremy Lutz play guitar and drums, respectively. Highly skilled and self-taught, their musical chemistry is the life blood of Chrono. Vocalist and synth player Ashley Frary joined with keyboardist Mandi Work in April of 2012. Together they brought a softer, more whimsical sound and powerful, multi-faceted vocals. The newest member, bassist Kevin Cupka Head, joined in October of 2012 after demonstrating incredible technical proficiency and a seamless integration of commanding riffs and improvisation skills.\n\nThis is the band's debut album, Seasons. \n\nTheir website can be found here:\n\nchronoband.com\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc457ce1bb5534501c913a9fa2acbcde719f6697","amp;dn":"Chrono+Stellaris+-+Seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc457ce1bb5534501c913a9fa2acbcde719f6697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,69,124,225,187,85,52,80,28,145,58,159,162,172,188,222,113,159,102,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
