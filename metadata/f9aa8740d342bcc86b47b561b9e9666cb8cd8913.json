The movie is of the old-school nomadic, skate-everything-in-your-path genre with interludes of stopping to rip-up a big ramp, pool or kicker. After much searching and skateboarding, they locate a large ramp in the desert. They also find a Chinese character on the inside of the ramp's spine. They conclude that in searching for Mr. Chin, they may have found his spirit.\n\n\nBones Brigade:\nTony Hawk - Himself\nSteve Caballero - Himself\nMike McGill - Himself\nLance Mountain - Himself\nTommy Guerrero - Himself\n\nThe film also includes:\nEmerson (Aka: Won Ton Animal) Chin - Himself\n\nSan Francisco Scene: Jim Thiebaud, Jesse Martinez, Bryce Kanights, Doug Smith\n\nBakersfield Scene: Chris Borst, Bobby Reeves, Charlie Dubois, Ray Underhill, Adrian Demain, Donny Griffin, Kevin Lambert\n\nRad Party Scene: Mike Vallely, Rodney Mullen, Per Welinder, Natas Kaupas, Arron Murray, Kevin Harris\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDimensions: 640x480\nCodecs: H.264, AAC\nDuration: 1:04:03\nAudio Channels: 2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9aa8740d342bcc86b47b561b9e9666cb8cd8913","amp;dn":"The+Search+for+Animal+Chin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9aa8740d342bcc86b47b561b9e9666cb8cd8913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,170,135,64,211,66,188,200,107,71,181,97,185,233,102,108,184,205,137,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
