We \nshall be careful in our use of this word, if only to \nbring it down from the fantastic heights to which \nthe. popular press has elevated it. \nOn the whole, attempts at popularisation are \nlaudable enough, but when it comes to modern \nphysics they are fraught with danger. Here reality \nis often represented by mathematical \nequations \nbeyond the reader's grasp, a fact which encourages \nmany a sensationalist writer to indulge in fantasies. \nThe current interest in anti-particles is by no means \ndue to their noveltyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½their existence was predicted \nin a theoretical paper published as long ago as March \n1930, and the first anti-particle (the positive electron) \nwas observed and identified in 1933. At the time the \nnews caused no stir outside the very narrow circle \nof specialists. \nNowadays, the moment a new particle is identified, \nit is announced to the public, and despite the reserve \nof physicists, the popular press has no hesitation in \npontificating about its unknown properties. \nThough not brand-new, therefore, the problem of \nanti-particles is nevertheless of great interest, no only because of the old questions it resolves but also \nbecause of the new questions it poses. \nThe discovery of anti-protons and anti-neutrons \nhas confirmed the general validity of the theory, \npresented by Dirac, a young English mathematician, \nto the Royal Society on the 6th December, 1929. \nDo anti-particles have the property of combining \nto form a negative anti-nucleus which, together with \npositive electrons would make up an anti-atom? Is \nthis how we must conceive the structure of so-called \nantimatter? \nInasmuch as so small a book can do justice to the \nlabours of some of the greatest scientists of the past \nthirty years, I shall try to show what discoveries have \nled physicists to ask these and similar questions.\n\nNo ISBN\n127 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b2d3f711e2a3b54d011323e8a0370e8bb27ad1","amp;dn":"Matter+and+Antimatter+-+Maurice+Duquesne+-+1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b2d3f711e2a3b54d011323e8a0370e8bb27ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,178,211,247,17,226,163,181,77,1,19,35,232,160,55,14,139,178,122,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
