It's members are Bossun, the leader; Himeko, the blond girl with a kansai-accent; and bespectacled Switch, intellectual otaku. No matter what your problem may be, they will do their best to help you.\n\nOn paper, this sounds cool but the reality is that they usually just laze away in their clubroom. The occasional requests that they do receive are usually trivial matters such as searching for lost objects.\n\nEpisode: 1-67\nSubs: HorribleSubs (english)\nVideo: H.264 720p\nAudio: AAC\nEncoder: Deadfish\n\nMore info: http://www.anidb.net/a8039","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58aa09d9f24c4c3e73f8075b522a9ad7e70acfec","amp;dn":"%5BDeadFish%5D+SKET+Dance+1-67+Batch+%5B720p%5D%5BMP4%5D%5BAAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58aa09d9f24c4c3e73f8075b522a9ad7e70acfec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,170,9,217,242,76,76,62,115,248,7,91,82,42,154,215,231,10,207,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
