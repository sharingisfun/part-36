Determined to look more sexy and mature, Sumi takes an experimental growth hormone that her scientist father has been developing.\nHowever, the medicine backfires. Instead of changing into a buxom femme fatale, Sumi changes into a beautiful young man! She--he--is so gorgeous and so cool that even Mitsuru begins to take notice. Although the new situation with Mitsuru is imperfect, Sumi discovers that she can be closer to her crush: they can talk man-to-man. Yet, being Mitsuru's friend also has a downside, particularly when he reveals that he is in love with a girl in his grade!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6093bc55cfeda167c806450bfcfd810f5173062","amp;dn":"CuteXGuy+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6093bc55cfeda167c806450bfcfd810f5173062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,9,59,197,92,254,218,22,124,128,100,80,191,207,216,16,245,23,48,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
