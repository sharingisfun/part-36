How to Get Back on Your Feet, Fast!\n\nIf you've just lost your job, your savings, or your home, this book will show you the way back. First, read a special book first published back in the 1930s but still available on Amazon. Next, raise some immediate cash in one of two ways. Last but far from least, seriously consider a move to greener pastures.\n\nThe author is JJ Luna, author of the best-selling book on personal privacy, HOW TO BE INVISIBLE. Luna says he has never been Ã¢â‚¬Å“poor,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but admits to being fired from a number of jobs when he was young, and running completely out of cash in 1949, 1953, 1974, and (hopefully for the last time!) in 1979.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Losing your home or your job may be a blessing in disguise,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says, remembering his own experiences and those of his friends. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your best years may be yet to come.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17dd62ae574f0d9043383f3d90be2637bdd326c","amp;dn":"Flat.Broke.How.to.Get.Back.on.Your.Feet.Fast.J.J.Luna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17dd62ae574f0d9043383f3d90be2637bdd326c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,125,214,42,229,116,240,217,4,51,131,243,217,11,226,99,123,221,50,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
