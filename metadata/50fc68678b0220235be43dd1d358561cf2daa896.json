Now, you can build your own Unreal game for the iOS platform.\nBeginning iOS 3D Unreal Games Development covers using the Unreal UDK game creation system to create 3D games for the iOS platform, which includes the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.\n\n\nSpecifically, this book covers:\n\nUnrealScript programming language, going beyond the limitations of the visual Kismet scripting language\nThe Unreal UDK code framework, basic UDK tools and other UDK items needed to build a game\nVarious author-created game frameworks are presented and are used to illustrate the UnrealScript programming language and user input methods specific to the iOS mobile platform\n\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\nWhat the UnrealScript programming language is and does\nThe basic Unreal UDK base code framework\nWhat the basic Unreal tools used to make a game\nWhat the key parts of the Unreal engine such as the physics engine\nHow to do the fundamentals of 3D games programming, including basic 3D math\nWhat are the the basic frameworks of many different types of games\nHow to use the provided source code to build your own games using the frameworks as a reference\n\nWho this book is for\nGame programmers, both professional and hobbyists, interested in developing 3D games for the iOS platform using the Unreal UDK. Additionally, students using the Unreal UDK in their coursework. Finally, game designers who are not experienced programmers but are interested in learning enough about UnrealScript and the Unreal UDK to make small changes to game code created by contracted programmers (For example: changing code to increase the health of a player or change the message displayed when a player dies).
