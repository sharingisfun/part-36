Readers are advised to stop blindly accepting that they are ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¿disadvantagedÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ people with limited options. They are encouraged to act beyond their concept of limited options and challenge the preconception that they will struggle financially all of their lives.\n\nRobertÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s fresh approach to his time-tested messages includes clear, actionable steps that any individual or family can take, starting with education. Education becomes applied knowledge, a powerful tactic with measurable results.\n\nIn true Rich Dad style, readers will be challenged to understand two points of view, and experience how financial knowledge is their unfair advantage.\n\nWhy do the rich get richer even in a financial crisis? In his new book, An Unfair Advantage, Robert confirms his message and challenges readers to change their context and act in a new way. Readers are advised to stop blindly accepting that they are ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¿disadvantagedÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ people with limited options and challenge the notion that they will struggle, financially, all their lives.\n\nWhat does school teach you about money? In most cases, the answer is ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Not much.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ If there is any financial education, the courses are taught by financial planners and bankersÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª the agents of Wall Street and the big banks, the very people that caused and profited from the financial crisis.\n\nThis book is about real financial education. This book is about how debt and taxes make the rich richer &amp;hellip and why debt and taxes makes the poor and middle class struggle.\n\nThis book explains why the rich get richer, paying less in taxes, while the middle class shrinks &amp;mdash with many losing jobs, homes, and retirement &amp;mdash and paying more in taxes. This book is about the five unfair advantages a real financial education offers.\nThe Unfair Advantage of Knowledge\nThe Unfair Advantage of Taxes\nThe Unfair Advantage of Debt\nThe Unfair Advantage of Risk\nThe Unfair Advantage of Compensation\nThese five unfair advantages are the outcomes of real financial education.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f101dca6db108a68a09e4f4c6b21a7f7c96bf5f9","amp;dn":"Robert+Kiyosaki-UnfairAdvantage%3AThe+power+of+financial+education","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f101dca6db108a68a09e4f4c6b21a7f7c96bf5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,1,220,166,219,16,138,104,160,158,79,76,107,33,167,247,201,107,245,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
