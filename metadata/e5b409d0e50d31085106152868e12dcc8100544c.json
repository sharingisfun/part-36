It gives you the famous analog non-linearity that creates a warm and rich sound.\n\nThe amout of drive depends on the frequency, with higher frequencies more driven than the lower ones.\n\nReel to reel magic\n\nWARMultipress reproduces the unique subtle sound coloration of audio tapes that makes your digital music more natural and punchy.\n\nWARMultipress mimics the classic AmpexÃ‚Â® ATR 102 ( 15 IPS ) frequency response\n\n\nCompression - Control the dynamics\n\nBass, middle and treble frequencies can be compressed independently. So a heavy drums kick compression won't affect your guitar or cymbals level for example.\n\nEach band compressor has an adjustable input and output gain.\n\nIt features traditional compression parameters:\n\n    Attack time: the time it takes to reach the maximum gain reduction level\n    Release time: the time needed to reduce gain reduction to 0 when it's no more required\n    Threshold: minimum level of input signal (after Pre gain stage) needed to activate gain reduction\n    Ratio: amount of gain reduction applied to the output signal, from 0% (off) to 100% (full on), when input exceeds the Threshold\n\n\nFrequency separation - Transparent 3 band split\n\nThe 3 band splitter preserves all the caracteristics of the original signal. With 0dB Pre and Post gain and no gain reduction, the signal after compression stage is exactly equal to the input.\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n-  Next open the rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.\n\n- Copy required files from x86/x64 Folder and place to your VSTPlugins folder.\n\n\n-  That's it. Done. enjoY!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b409d0e50d31085106152868e12dcc8100544c","amp;dn":"LSR+Audio+WARMultipress+VST+v0.3.0+beta+x86+x64+-+ST3RE0+%5Bdeepst","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b409d0e50d31085106152868e12dcc8100544c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,180,9,208,229,13,49,8,81,6,21,40,104,225,45,204,129,0,84,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
