Environment artist David Lesperance will guide you through his process for developing 3D environments in Environment Production Workflow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tips, Tricks and Concepts. Various topics are addressed in this lecture, starting with the composition and layout of the scene, lighting, materials, textures, and sculpting techniques. David begins his lecture on composition and layout, along with some of the techniques he uses to find the best composition for the environment he is designing. This includes finding the right mood and using some quick AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® tricks to enhance the lighting in the scene He then moves into AutodeskÃ‚Â® 3ds MaxÃ‚Â® to go over his process for developing materials in V-RayÃ‚Â®, starting with glass and various metal materials, pointing out various options in the V-RayÃ‚Â® material to make it easier to troubleshoot issues when they arise. His lecture then moves into terrain modeling, discussing a series of techniques he uses to design convincing terrains. He first discusses a technique for blending surfaces, starting by sculpting some high resolution rock formations using ZBrush4R4Ã‚Â® and combining them in 3ds MaxÃ‚Â® using some Boolean operations. He then demonstrates how blend materials across the surfaces using vertex paint to control a mask within a Blend Material. Next he moves on to terrain building using World Machine to generate fractal based terrain maps and exporting displacement maps to rapidly create terrain assets. David's next series of lectures focus on the practical layout, composition, texturing, and lighting a digital environment. Here, he focuses on the build process, starting with rough layout, then adding various rubble assets before moving into lighting and texturing the environment. During the texture phase, he discusses texture scale issues and demonstrates how to keep texture scale consistent across multiple assets. His final set of lectures focus primarily on rapid modeling and sculpting techniques he employs in his workflow. Here, David discusses everything from high-resolution sub-D modeling in 3ds MaxÃ‚Â® to high resolution sculpting techniques in ZBrushÃ‚Â®. His primary focus inside ZBrushÃ‚Â® is the use of the new Insert Multi Mesh tool and the latest updates to Dynamesh in ZBrush4R4Ã‚Â®. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/3382/66lw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/3382/66lw.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5466ac3169b794ab8676b488cd1f05887ece61e4","amp;dn":"Environment+Production+Workflow+%26ndash%3B+Tips_Tricks+and+Concepts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5466ac3169b794ab8676b488cd1f05887ece61e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,102,172,49,105,183,148,171,134,118,180,136,205,31,5,136,126,206,97,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
