I'm also uploading a comic book as testament to this.\n\nNow that Marvel is owned by Disney, I'm looking forward to what other crossover easter eggs will be seeded in Marvel content.\n\n1280 x 502, 24 fps, MKV\n\nI'm not sure what the release aspect ratio was supposed to be. The DVD looks &quot;squished&quot; to me and listings vary from 1.37:1 and 2.55:1.\n\nI've corrected for what appears to be proportionally correct to my eye, 2.35:1. My criteria are the proportions of the IATSE and RCA logos in the intro credits (the logos are supposed to be perfectly round) as well as the proportions of the actors. Peter Lorre was short, but he wasn't a dwarf.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c07de6e9b7f9e8b392ed682de1f76259ef6810","amp;dn":"20%2C000+Leagues+Under+the+Sea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c07de6e9b7f9e8b392ed682de1f76259ef6810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,192,125,230,233,183,249,232,179,146,237,104,45,225,247,98,89,239,104,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
