I've known Alfredo since I was 13 and we've waited until now to get together and see what happens. And the results were a lot of fun and we really like the record. Alfredo called me, we were all living in the desert at the time. I was living with Dave. Alfredo had just gotten off of the road with Queens Of The Stone Age and he gave me a call and said 'look man, I just left the band' and I said, 'oh wow, OK' and we chatted about that. I've lived with Dave for the last year and a and Dave is just an insane bass player. I've loved his bass playing for years and weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve been best friends, but ironically enough, we never played together, or at least in a long time and I said, 'we've got this house, would you be interested in coming over to jam?' So he came over and we just started jamming. And within about a month we were sitting on a handful of songs.&quot; - Brant Bjork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers:\n\n\n    * Brant Bjork (Kyuss, Fu Manchu) - Vocals, Guitar\n    * Dave Dinsmore (Unida) - Bass\n    * Alfredo HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez (Yawning Man, Kyuss, Vic du Monte, Queens of the Stone Age) - Drums\n\n\n\n\n                    _Steffengd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2110ccd1c6beea825eea1951fbbb397f8b29a5c3","amp;dn":"Che+-+Sounds+of+Liberation+++++By++++++_Steffengd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2110ccd1c6beea825eea1951fbbb397f8b29a5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,16,204,209,198,190,234,130,94,234,25,81,251,187,57,127,139,41,165,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
