Beautifully recorded by Greg Weeks, the songs are cast in rich, detailed arrangements with Alec K. Redfearn (The Eyesores), Greg Weeks and Meg Baird (the Espers), and several other Philadelphia-area luminaries contributing to the sweeping sound. At the heart is MargieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong voice, cello, and guitar, leading the tunes with feeling and subtlety. While in the tradition of electric-trad legends such as Pentangle and Trees, Fern KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music rings of the intensely personal and is delivered with crystal clarity, not the hipsterÃ¢â‚¬â€œfuzz obfuscation of some contempo Ã¢â‚¬Å“folk.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ M4W&amp;A is Fern KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first domestic release, following their barely available debut on the German Normal label.\n\n[color=navy]FROM AQUARIUS RECORDS:[/color]\nAnother gorgeous missive from the ever expanding world of modern freak folk, this time from Philly based singer, songwriter, guitarist, cellist Margaret Wienk, who with Music For Witches and Alchemists has crafted a darkly dramatic gem of moody mournful melancholia. Equal parts Pentangle, Incredible String Band, and of course some of her more modern sonic compatriots, Brightblack, Vetiver, Espers (Greg Weeks and Meg Baird both play on Music For Witches and Alchemists) and the like, Fern Knight is most definitely modern folk, but at the same time sounds so classic, the songwriting, Wienk's voice, the arrangements, a perfect combination. But the band manage to take that classic sound and infuse it with some sweet sonic mystery, due in no small part to the unlikely instrumentation, the sweet moaning cellos, dreamy swaths of harp, alien melodies on the singing saw, the twang of the Jew's harp, the wheezing harmonium, but unlike most bands, those sounds don't define Fern Knight's sound, merely add to the texture and mood of the music, which even stripped to its bare basics would still sound as sweet..[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a960738e16867714d5714de71327c64bc3ea873a","amp;dn":"Fern+Knight+-+Music+for+Witches+and+Alchemists+%5B2006%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Cc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a960738e16867714d5714de71327c64bc3ea873a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,96,115,142,22,134,119,20,213,113,77,231,19,39,198,75,195,234,135,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
