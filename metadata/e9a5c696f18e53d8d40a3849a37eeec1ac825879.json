Undoubtedly better than the first (which was catastrophic), it does not remain about it less than there was to really better do than the album than it produced. \n\nThe choice of the titles operated by Douglas on Live Isle Of Wight '70 is far from being satisfactory: it draws aside Sgt. Pepper' S Lonely Hearts Club Band (however present on Hendrix In The West ), Spanish Castle Magic (but its presence on the video becomes a sales point), All Along The Watchtower , Purple Haze (then new) and a broad part of Machine Gun , preferring to deliver a version published without musical quality to us. \n\nThe small pocket itself is not very professional: Voodoo Chile is in fact Voodoo Child (Slight Return) and New Rising Sun is not the title which it will publish in opening of Voodoo Soup but well Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) . Moreover, the mention ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ contains 7 new titles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is untrue: if To coil Man and In From The Storm of course appeared the first album devoted to Wight ( Isle Of Wight ), Message To Love was present on The First Great Rock Festivals off the Seventies , God Save The Queen on Hendrix In The West , Machine Gun and Red House on the original soundtrack of the film Jimi Hendrix and Dolly Dagger on Jimi Hendrix - Live ! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ thus had to be read contains 7 titles already published ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½! \n\nAnother negative aspect of Live Isle Off Wight '70 : its mixing. \nHendrix had encountered large engineering problems at the time of its performance, and the sound of its guitar does not have its usual stamp. \nThe Mixage the Douglas one still reinforces with dimensions metal sound of the guitar, without roundness, almost nightmarishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\nTitles \nIntro/God Save The Queen \nMessage To Love \nVoodoo Chile \nLover Man \nMachine Gun \nDolly Dagger \nRed House \nIn From The Storm \nNew Rising Sun \n\nA charcutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© concert \nAs on Training courses - Atlanta 70 , Douglas altered the order of the titles: \n\nGod Save the Queen 1 \nSgt. Pepper' S Lonely Hearts Club Band \nSpanish Castle Magic \nAll Along The Watchtower \nMachine Gun 5 \nTo coil Man 4 \nFreedom \nRed House 7 \nDolly Dagger 6 \nMidnight Lightnin' \nFoxy Lady \nMessage To Love 2 \nHey Baby (New Rising Sun) 9 \nEzy Ryder \nHey Joe \nPurple Haze \nVoodoo Child (Slight Return) 3 \nIn From The Storm 8 \n\nVoodoo Child (Slight Return) , always played at the end of the concert is found at the beginning of CD whereas Red House is played in first part of concertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \nThe dynamics in the concert is completely broken. \nTo remove Sgt. Pepper' S Lonely Hearts Club Band after the English anthem (as well as various the cuts) definitively completes this rebuilding missed by the performance of Jimi Hendrix in the Island of Wight.\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9a5c696f18e53d8d40a3849a37eeec1ac825879","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+1970-08-30+Live+Isle+Of+Wight+%5C%2770+Polydor-1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9a5c696f18e53d8d40a3849a37eeec1ac825879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,165,198,150,241,142,83,216,212,10,56,73,163,126,238,193,172,130,88,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
