Their last two studio albums could have been much better seeing the impressive catalog built up on their first two albums alone. Nevertheless, Supergrass is an amazing singles band and they never disappoint in that respect. Whenever a new Supergrass album comes around it's almost guaranteed you can find several gems on it immediately. That's what makes Supergrass Is 10 such a treat: it's all the past Supergrass greatness gathered on to one perfectly mixed compilation. Every moment here is alive and absolutely filled to the brim with that pure energy one expects from Supergrass singles and there isn't a single dull moment in the entire group. Very few bands can make a greatest hits album that would be able to hold a candle to Supergrass Is 10, which is surely a thought that will come across listener's minds as they take the time to relive all the great moments had with this hugely underrated band. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img212.imageshack.us/img212/3528/166872m4ou.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img212.imageshack.us/img212/3528/166872m4ou.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nCaught By The Fuzz\nPumping On Your Stereo\nAlright\nMoving\nRichard III\nGrace\nLate In The Day\nSeen The Light\nMansize Rooster\nSun Hits The Sky\nKiss Of Life\nMary\nGoing Out\nLenny\nBullet\nItÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Not Me\nRush Hour Soul\nStrange Ones\nLose It\nTime\nWait For The Sun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f8eee73ab14d71a7fa9b51143f4224604fa2ee","amp;dn":"Supergrass+-+Supergrass+is+10+-+The+Best+of+94-04+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f8eee73ab14d71a7fa9b51143f4224604fa2ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,248,238,231,58,177,77,113,167,250,155,81,20,63,66,36,96,79,162,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
