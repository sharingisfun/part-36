Let others download it from You (from Your point of view You will be Uploading to Others), as You were downloading it from Others. But if You want to move downloaded stuff somewhere else on Your HD, You can Seed after that in two ways:\n\n1. Before You will move the file, right-click with Your mouse on torrent in uTorrent and pick option &quot;Stop&quot;. Than move downloaded stuff where ever You want, and do what I showed on Screen No. 6 (Right-click on stopped torrent, Advanced-Set Download Location [place when You've putted dl'ed catalogue/file] and press OK - uTorrent will do checking of the torrent and You will be Seeding again.\n2. Please follow screens from 1 to 5.\n\nI hope this will help at least some of You.\n\n\nAnd please remember - SHARING is one of the most important things in life. Not only Sharing files via internet, but also Sharing Your Self and Your Feeling/Ideas with Others. \n\n\nI wish You All Best !!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde9f588c077a0c6ad38654e87434521ec87e9c0","amp;dn":"How+to+Seed+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde9f588c077a0c6ad38654e87434521ec87e9c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,233,245,136,192,119,160,198,173,56,101,78,135,67,69,33,236,135,233,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
