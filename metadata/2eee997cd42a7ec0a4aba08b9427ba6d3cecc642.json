The Doorbell Rang    4/22/2001\nEccentric millionaire Rachel Bruner arrives at Wolfe&amp;#039;s doorstep with an extraordinary offer, a disturbing story of harassment, and an FBI tail. Only after Wolfe takes the case does a murder comes to light. As the story unfolds, however, it becomes clear that the Bureau is not guilty - of murder, anyway - and their reluctant cooperation is essential to capturing a killer.\n\nWriter: Michael Jaffe\nDirector: Timothy Hutton\nGuest star: Boyd Banks (Skinny Agent), Harant Alianak (Vincent Yarmack), Robert Bockstael (Timothy Quayle), Steve Cumyn (Frank Odell), Nicky Gaudagni (Mrs. Ivana Althaus), R.D.
