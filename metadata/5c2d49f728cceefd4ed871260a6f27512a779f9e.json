The British Hit Singles &amp; Albums noted that they were &quot;tartan teen sensations from Edinburgh&quot;, and were &quot;the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since The Beatles' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s&quot;.[1] For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed &quot;Rollermania&quot;), they were worldwide teen idols. The group's line-up featured numerous changes over the years, but the classic line-up during its heyday included guitarists Eric Faulkner and Stuart Wood, singer Les McKeown, bassist Alan Longmuir, and drummer Derek Longmuir.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c2d49f728cceefd4ed871260a6f27512a779f9e","amp;dn":"The+Bay+City+Rollers+++%28The+Collector%5C%27s+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c2d49f728cceefd4ed871260a6f27512a779f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,45,73,247,40,204,238,253,78,216,113,38,10,111,39,81,42,119,159,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
