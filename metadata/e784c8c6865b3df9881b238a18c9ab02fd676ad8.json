Written by Dwayne McDuffie with art by Scott Kolins, it is more or less exactly what you'd expect and delivers lots of action (and a few laughs). These nice and new digital copies are by AnPymHero-Empire, so thanks to them. Please seed, enjoy! :-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e784c8c6865b3df9881b238a18c9ab02fd676ad8","amp;dn":"Beyond%21+01-06+%282006%7CDigital%7CAnPymHero-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e784c8c6865b3df9881b238a18c9ab02fd676ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,132,200,198,134,91,61,249,136,27,35,138,24,201,171,2,253,103,106,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
