The other edge of the blade is more psychological than cultural and consists of the Communist use of music directed at destroying the mental and emotional stability of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youth through a scheme capable of producing mass neurosis.\n\nThe Communist infiltration into the subversion of American music has been nothing short of phenomenal and in some areas their control is fast approaching the saturation point.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid A. Noebel (born August 27, 1936) is an American religious leader and writer. He is the former director of Summit Ministries, in Manitou Springs, Colorado in the United States. Since the 1960s, he has written widely on the relationship between religion and popular culture, and is an outspoken critic of secular humanism, which he describes as unscientific and a religion.\n\nNoebel was a former Associate Evangelist of Billy James Hargis's Christian Crusade. Noebel served as vice-president and president of American Christian College, which Hargis had founded in 1971 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It closed in 1977, three years after Hargis resigned following allegations of sexual conduct against Hargis. He was a member of the Council for National Policy beginning in 1984, and a candidate for Congress. Noebel was awarded an honorary doctorate from American Christian College while in its employ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0068eee7a53c9d4e4d9fc16e0bc1d3854b2bc816","amp;dn":"Rhythm%2C+Riots+and+Revolution+-+David+Noebel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0068eee7a53c9d4e4d9fc16e0bc1d3854b2bc816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,104,238,231,165,60,157,78,77,159,193,110,11,193,211,133,75,43,200,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
