Henry wants his youngest son, the future King John, to inherit his throne, while his estranged and imprisoned wife, Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, favours their oldest surviving son, the future King Richard the Lionheart. Meanwhile, King Philip II of France, the son and successor of Louis VII of France, Eleanor's ex-husband, has given his half-sister Alais, who is currently Henry's mistress, to the future heir, and demands either a wedding or the return of her dowry.\n\nAs a ruse, Henry agrees to give Alais to Richard and make him heir-apparent. He makes a side deal with Eleanor for her freedom in return for Aquitaine, to be given to John. When the deal is revealed at the wedding, Richard refuses to go through with the ceremony. After Richard leaves, Eleanor masochistically asks Henry to kiss Alais in front of her, and then looks on in horror as they perform a mock marriage ceremony. Having believed Henry's intentions, John, at the direction of middle brother, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, plots with Philip to make war on England. Henry and Phillip meet to discuss terms, but Henry soon learns that Phillip has been plotting with John and Geoffrey, and that he and Richard were once lovers.\n\nHenry dismisses all three sons as unsuitable, and locks them in the dungeon. He makes plans to travel to Rome for an annulment, so that he can have new sons with Alais, but she says he will never be able to release his sons from prison or they will be a threat to his future children. Henry sees that she is right and condemns them to death, but cannot bring himself to kill them, instead letting them escape. He and Eleanor go back to hoping for the future, with Eleanor going back on the barge to prison, laughing it off with Henry before she leaves.\n\nThough the background and the eventual destinies of the characters are historically accurate, The Lion in Winter is fictional; none of the dialogue or action is historical. There was a Christmas court at Caen in 1182 but there was no Christmas Court at Chinon in 1183. In reality, Henry had many mistresses and many illegitimate children; the &quot;Rosamund&quot; mentioned in the film was his mistress until she died. The article on the Revolt of 1173Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1174 describes the historical events leading to the play's events. As a matter of historical record, Richard the Lionheart succeeded Henry II, and was followed by John. Geoffrey died before his father","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:351e6760f6999bcd0f0282bc5b12ad7415478514","amp;dn":"The+Lion+in+Winter+%5B1968+film%5D+VOB+Files+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"351e6760f6999bcd0f0282bc5b12ad7415478514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,30,103,96,246,153,155,205,15,2,130,188,91,18,173,116,21,71,133,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
