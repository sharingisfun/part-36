It entered the US Billboard 200 chart on 20 November 1971, peaking at #11, and the UK chart on 3 December 1971, peaking at #9.[4] In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it #99 on their list of the 100 best albums of the period 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987.\n\nEvery track on the album with the exception of &quot;Boris the Spider&quot;, the one song written by John Entwistle, had been released as a single in the UK, with all except &quot;A Legal Matter&quot;, &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, and &quot;The Seeker&quot; being top ten hits. &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; had also been Top 40 hits in the US. It was compiled by Pete Townshend over objection by manager Kit Lambert, who tried to have the track order changed but failed because too many copies had already been pressed.[citation needed] The UK release was held up because The Who and Bill Curbishley had failed to clear it with Lambert.[citation needed]\n\nThe album title is referential of traits of the members of the band, Meaty: Daltrey, who was quite fit at the time, Beaty: Moon, for his drumming, Big: Entwistle, who was a large person, often referred to as &quot;The Ox&quot;, and Bouncy: Townshend, who jumped about quite acrobatically during performances.[citation needed]\n\nThe original vinyl album featured a longer alternate studio take of &quot;Magic Bus&quot; in fake stereo which was not included on the original compact disc version, because the true stereo or mono source could not be found for the long version of the song.[citation needed] However, on 25 July 2007, Universal Japan re-released the album in a mini-LP sleeve that includes the long alternate version of &quot;Magic Bus&quot; in fake stereo, as with the original album.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n2007 Universal Japan re-release\n\n\n    &quot;I Can't Explain&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:05\n    &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n    &quot;Happy Jack&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:12\n    &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:06\n    &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n    &quot;My Generation&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n    &quot;The Seeker&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:11\n    &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot; (Roger Daltrey, Townshend) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:42\n    &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n    &quot;A Legal Matter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n    &quot;Boris the Spider&quot; (John Entwistle) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:28\n    &quot;Magic Bus&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:33 \n    &quot;Substitute&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;I'm a Boy&quot; (extended version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6aece3b3201623a655a62eaa0613510aad85be","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Meaty+Beaty+Big+And+Bouncy+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6aece3b3201623a655a62eaa0613510aad85be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,106,236,227,179,32,22,35,166,85,166,46,170,6,19,81,10,173,133,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
