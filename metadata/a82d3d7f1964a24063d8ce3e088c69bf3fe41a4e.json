S. King is a private investigative journalist and researcher based in the New York City area. A 1987 graduate of Rutgers University, King's subsequent 30 year career in Marketing &amp; Advertising has equipped him with a unique perspective when it comes to understanding how &quot;public opinion&quot; is indeed scientifically manufactured.\nMadison Ave marketing acumen combines with 'City Boy' instincts to make M.S. King one of the most tenacious detectors of &quot;things that donâ€™t add up&quot; in the world today. Says King of his admitted quirks, irreverent disdain for &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;, and uncanny ability to ferret out and weave together important data points that others miss: &quot;Had Sherlock Holmes been an actual historical personage, I would have been his reincarnation.&quot;\nKing is also the author of The War Against Putin: What the Government-Media Complex Isnâ€™t Telling You About Russia. Kingâ€™s other interests include: the animal kingdom, philosophy, chess, cooking, literature and history (with emphasis on events of the late 19th through the 20th centuries).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82d3d7f1964a24063d8ce3e088c69bf3fe41a4e","amp;dn":"Michael+S.+King+ebook+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82d3d7f1964a24063d8ce3e088c69bf3fe41a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,45,61,127,25,100,162,64,99,216,206,62,8,140,105,191,63,228,26,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
