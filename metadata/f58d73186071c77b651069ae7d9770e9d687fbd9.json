Shad, John Simon, Paul Rothchild.\n\nCompilation producer: Bob Irwin.\n\nRecorded between 1966 &amp; 1970. Includes liner notes by Ellen Willis, Ann Powers.\n\nDigitally remastered by Vic Anesini (Sony Music Studios, New York, New York).\n\nThe total of Janis Joplin's recorded output released in her lifetime wasn't that much bigger than what would fit on three CDs. That said, this triple disc set handily captures all that made her remarkable then and memorable now. Spanning only five years as a recording artist, she threw herself completely into everything from raunchy psychedelic blues (Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company) to more sparkling uptown productions (Kozmic Blues Band, Full Tilt Boogie Band). Tellingly, she sounds like the true link between these bands primarily in live performance recordings.\n\nIn the studio and in the hands of a producer she sounded fabulous, but her certain edge was occasionally masked or dulled. Dying at the age of 27, she never had the chance to sort through her fascination and facility with this wide range of the blues and see where it would lead her next. JANIS is a riveting look into the life of a naturally powerful singer and performer. Lovingly assembled, the accompanying book includes thoughtful essays, photos, and a discography--reading and listening makes her seem even more powerful.\nEntertainment Reviews:\n\nRolling Stone - 5/13/99, p.52\nIncluded in Rolling Stone's &quot;Essential Recordings of the 90's.&quot;\n\nRolling Stone - 12/23/93, p.148\n4 Stars - Excellent - &quot;...It would be hard to imagine a better representation of Joplin's career...Stretching from her college days in Austin, Texas, to the posthumous hit `Me And Bobby McGee,' it offers a near perfect blend of home tapes, concert recordings, outtakes and album tracks....&quot;\n\nRolling Stone - 12/23/93, p.148\n4 Stars - Excellent - &quot;...It would be hard to imagine a better representation of Joplin's career...Stretching from her college days in Austin, Texas, to the posthumous hit 'Me And Bobby McGee,' it offers a near perfect blend of home tapes, concert recordings, outtakes and album tracks....&quot;\n\nEntertainment Weekly - 12/24/93, p.60\n&quot;...Joplin stands up as one of our most powerful singers, whether crooning gently or rocking passionately, and always with the insistent rhythm of the greatest jazz artists.
