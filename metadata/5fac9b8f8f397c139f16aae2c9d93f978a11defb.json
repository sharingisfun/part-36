Unlike in previous updates,\n          version 1.2 introduces all-new gameplay elements to enhance the overall\n          gaming experience. Venturing through the forest is now most unsettling due\n          to new hazards. The player acquires the ability to throw items to defend\n          himself. He can use stealth tactics and agility to survive.\n\n          So many new stuff/gameplay changes (plus bugfixxes). An update wouldnt do\n          the trick. so here is a FULL release of version 1.2 of this awesome indie\n          horror title!\n                                   (Like = buy you bum!)\n\n\n                              G + R + E + E + T + I + N + G + S\n\n\n            VOMIT  DOCUMENT  EAT  BRD  AiR  FiCO  XFORCE  VACE  COLLATERAL\n\n\n                                R + E + C + R + U + I + T + S\n\n\n                 LOOKING FOR A NICE SECURE PRIVATE 100MBIT+ AFFIL.
