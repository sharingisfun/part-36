I believe that Roland HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ novel should be considered as important as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ1984Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and Aldous HuxleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrave New WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Highly recommended as a thought provoking and fascinating read.Jeff Wallace said: Mr. Hughes book reminds me of reading Plato's books Phaedo and Meno.What if the Mayans got the start of the end correct because they had survived it once before? What if our written history was just as accurate as the old tale about three blind men describing an elephant? What if classic science fiction writing and television shows each got a piece of it correct, would you know which ones? If your eyes can only see a tiny portion of a collage do you know it is a collage?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a08ce1a59b8ce3c54b505bd9bd1f2ab928de256","amp;dn":"John+Smith+-+Last-Known-Survivor-of-the-Microsoft-Wars+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a08ce1a59b8ce3c54b505bd9bd1f2ab928de256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,8,206,26,89,184,206,60,84,181,5,189,155,209,242,171,146,141,226,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
