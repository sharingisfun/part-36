It begins with general topics in plant virology including movement of viruses in plants, the transmission of plant viruses by vectors, and the development of virus-resistant transgenic plants. The second section presents an overview of the properties of a selection of 20 well-studied plant viruses, 23 plant virus genera and a few larger groups of plant viruses. The third section, which is abundantly illustrated, highlights the most economically important virus diseases of cereals, legumes, vegetable crops, fruit trees and ornamentals. The last section describes the major groups of viruses that infect fungi.\n# The most comprehensive single-volume source providing an overview of virology issues related to plant and fungi\n\n# Bridges the gap between basic undergraduate texts and specialized reviews\n\n# Concise and general overviews of important topics within the field will help in preparation of lectures, writing reports, or drafting grant applications\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 632 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (October 29, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123751489\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123751485","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78e4d039c6a0b144e0a25c7260214cf821cf8ab0","amp;dn":"Desk+Encyclopedia+of+Plant+and+Fungal+Virology+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78e4d039c6a0b144e0a25c7260214cf821cf8ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,228,208,57,198,160,177,68,224,162,92,114,96,33,76,248,33,207,138,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
