The environments and tracks are well detailed and varied. From the huge open vistas of an alpine setting to the more enclosed setting of stadium racing, each track that is created for this game has its own feeling and visual touches with lots going on (e.g. running water or crowds cheering wildly). Creating so many different environments makes for a game that remains fresh as you make your way from track to track during the career mode. Riders and bikes are also well animated and move with fluidity and realism along each track. Rainbow Studios has paid lots of attention to the small details in this area, from the different treads of different tires on ATVs to have having each riderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jersey ripple as you gain speed when you race, the attention to detail is uncanny. \n\nThe track deformation is also a very impressive addition. The ruts just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t magically appear on the track as you can actually see how the dirt, sand or mud begins to pile up along the tire tracks. You can see your vehicle tires actually kick up the dirt as you make your way around the track and leave the divots behind. All in all this area is very impressive and something that Rainbow Stuidos should be very proud off.\n\nTechnically speaking MX vs. ATV Reflex is a solid game. It runs at a very smooth framerate with no visible slowdown to speak of. The games graphics engine is pretty solid as the clipping and glitching is kept to a bare minimum. I did find the odd, and I say very odd, instance of screen tearing, but this was only when I was doing something freakishly stupid like running into the side of a cliff off the beaten path. You will also notice some texture draw in now and then but this is only evident if you are really looking for it. All in all this is a very technically sound game and the work that went into it really does show.\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY FEARLESS1964 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/FEARLESS1964/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/FEARLESS1964/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e7a8946c6f5720bc5b3050d152da9e23f3230b","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DMX+VS.ATV+REFLEX%5BUSA%5D%5BF1964%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e7a8946c6f5720bc5b3050d152da9e23f3230b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,231,168,148,108,111,87,32,188,91,48,80,209,82,218,158,35,243,35,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
