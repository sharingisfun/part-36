P. Cauvain and L. S. Young (Wiley-Blackwell, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4051-7613-2\r\n\r\nWater is the major contributor to the eating and keeping qualities and structure of baked products. Its management and control during preparation, processing, baking, cooling and storage is essential for the optimisation of product quality. This successful and highly practical volume describes in detail the role and control of water in the formation of cake batters, bread, pastry and biscuit doughs, their subsequent processing and the baked product.\r\n\r\nNow in a fully revised and updated second edition, the book has been expanded and developed through the inclusion of new information and references related to the formation and processing of batters and dough into baked products. The new edition includes a selection of case studies based on practical experience in the manufacture and optimisation of baked products. Each case study, illustrated as appropriate, considers the various roles that water may play in different manufacturing contexts. The book is aimed at food scientists and technologists in bakery companies; ingredient suppliers; flour millers; researchers and students in academic food science departments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc3d37ede3c13386f0200f761b31329757a373b","amp;dn":"Bakery+Food+Manufacture+and+Quality+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc3d37ede3c13386f0200f761b31329757a373b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,195,211,126,222,60,19,56,111,2,0,247,97,179,19,41,117,122,55,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
