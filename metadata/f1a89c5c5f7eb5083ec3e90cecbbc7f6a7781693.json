Loyal and hardworking, first to arrive and last to leave, Carla is beginning to chafe at the limitations of her career and is looking to move up. But as a 35-five-year-old woman with a hearing deficiency, she is not sure how to climb out of her humdrum life, though she is confident in her own abilities. Into her life comes Paul Angeli, a new trainee she decides to hire. Paul is 25 years old and completely unskilled, but Carla covers for him when the need arises because of his other qualities - he's a thief, fresh out of jail and very good-looking. It's a case of good meeting bad. Director: Jacques Audiard. Stars: Vincent Cassel, Emmanuelle Devos, Olivier Gourmet.\n\nFrom France, in French\n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a89c5c5f7eb5083ec3e90cecbbc7f6a7781693","amp;dn":"+Read+My+Lips+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a89c5c5f7eb5083ec3e90cecbbc7f6a7781693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,168,156,92,95,126,181,8,62,195,233,12,236,187,199,246,167,120,22,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
