Creatures travel for thousands of miles to visit in spectacular numbers, including tiger sharks, great whales, sea birds and the largest green turtle gathering on the planet.\n\nAlien creatures that are rarely seen, like nautilus, also rise out of the deep to visit the reef's warm waters. Weather systems travelling from across the Pacific also affect the whole reef, including mighty cyclones that bring destruction and chaos to the coral and the creatures that live on it. And it is weather patterns and climate change on a global scale that are likely to shape the future of the Great Barrier Reef and all its wildlife.\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080i to 1280*720p\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c513cc7d62cf1cba2f762ed3cd8b7316254ffe9c","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Great+Barrier+Reef+3+-+The+Reef+and+beyond+x264+AC3+720p.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c513cc7d62cf1cba2f762ed3cd8b7316254ffe9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,19,204,125,98,207,28,186,47,118,46,211,205,139,115,22,37,79,254,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
