Taped before a\n        live audience at the Chicago Theatre in Chicago, Ricky Gervais:\n        Out Of England 2 - The Stand-Up Special will feature brand-new\n        material and will showcase Gervais' signature humor and high-\n        spirited, offbeat observations. As in his previous special, the\n        show will include Gervais' unique takes on a variety of\n        disparate (and often politically incorrect) issues, including:\n        acts of God, the recession, the problem with heroin, fat people,\n        famine in Africa, animal homosexuality, the story of Noah's Ark,\n        and more.\n\n        ABOUT RICKY GERVAIS\n\n        After graduating from London University with a degree in\n        philosophy, Gervais had a brief stint in a pop band before a\n        longer one at a students' union, where he first started\n        developing material for The Office and the first incarnation of\n        David Brent, a character then called &quot;Seedy Boss.&quot; Following a\n        marketing job at London radio station XFM (where he was later\n        offered his own show), Gervais and his former assistant, Stephen\n        Merchant, collaborated on a project set in Ricky's old office.\n        Ricky became a regular contributor on for Channel 4's satirical\n        The Eleven O'Clock Show, and was soon presenting his own chat\n        show for the network, Meet Ricky Gervais. Then, Gervais and\n        Merchant created The Office, which became a huge hit on the BBC,\n        spawning the acclaimed (and still-running) U.S. version, and\n        winning a slew of prestigious awards, including two Golden\n        Globes, six BAFTAs, four British Comedy Awards and the\n        prestigious Peabody Award.\n\n        Gervais' film credits include the upcoming Cemetery Junction, as\n        well as The Invention of Lying, Ghost Town, Night at the Museum\n        and For Your Consideration. Gervais is also the only British\n        actor to write and star in an episode of The Simpsons.\n\n        Last January, Gervais became the first master of ceremonies to\n        host the Golden Globes since 1995, and will return as host in\n        2011. He was subsequently named on Time magazine's list of The\n        World's Most Influential People, and more recently received the\n        Sir Peter Ustinov Award for Comedy at the 2010 Banff World\n        Television Festival.\n                            \n                                 \n                                                  \n      \n            \n                                                     \n                                                 \n                                                                      \n\n      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
