It will take one to three hours and seem to be\nstuck at 60 percent but let it work. It will finish. Saves about 2GB for\nx64 version)\n\nChanges from recent Windows 8.0 AIO releases:\n-FINAL version of Win8.0-AIO\n-.Net4.5.1 added\n-Highly methodical manual integration for FINAL release to reduce unnecessary\nextra hotfixes.\n\nWindows 8.0 Final Notes:\n-I could keep integrating 8.0 and these versions would get incredibly large,\nbut a better option is to just support Microsoft's push to 8.1.\n-Windows 8.1 is basically the same as 8.0 now that they've patched a few\nperformance issues, and when the custom downloaded drivers become stable,\nit will be largely glitch-free.\n-MS has decided to end support for 8.0 in a couple years, but I'm not going\nto prolong the inevitable, especially to people who aren't paying for the\nproduct.\n-In 8.1, there is a /resetbase command that reduces the footprint of the\nwinsxs windows folder by removing uninstall information from installed\nKB-Files, and making the existing ones permanent. There wasn't really a\nstrong need for this in Windows 7 since all of the patches were small, but\nin 8.0 they started being HUGE. I think they patch a lot of graphical\ninformation in apps and such. It's the only reason I can think for them\nbeing so large.\n-The final version is not a patch because I'm likely going to be deleting\nold torrents in the future. Obviously I won't delete FINAL versions, in case\npeople still want to use them for some reason.\n-So please, if you like 8.0, great. I made this for you. Just please,\ndon't ask me to keep making monthly versions for it, because it's not going\nto happen. If you want to learn how to keep making 8.0 versions I have a\nthread on MDL for that very purpose: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/47875-Windows-Integration-Guide-murphy78&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/47875-Windows-Integration-Guide-murphy78&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCredits:\nanarchist9027 - MS DaRT8 SP1 boot.wim integration help\nCODYQX4, mikmik38, nosferati87 - KMS Server Service (Activator)\nmurphy78 - Integration, Pre-Activation scripting, testing, and ISO design\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nmurphy78-TPB/MDL :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c37bfeee6f07e8732d94644ac514817ac88fa344","amp;dn":"Windows+8.0+AIO+18in1+x64+en-US+Pre-Activated+FINAL+Nov2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c37bfeee6f07e8732d94644ac514817ac88fa344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,123,254,238,111,7,232,115,45,148,100,74,197,20,129,122,200,143,163,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
