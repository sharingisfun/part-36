I love this old stuff.  Sahib Shihab's\n\nbaritone adds extra &quot;meat&quot; to some of these tracks. Johnnie Splawn fills out\n\nthe front line on trumpet.\n\n\n\nDigitally remastered for CD 1987    Van Gelder recording","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff2aac65676abc6b8f3804dae4bfa5e6b1b7718b","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane%2CCOLTRANE%2C1957%2CPrestige+7105","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff2aac65676abc6b8f3804dae4bfa5e6b1b7718b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,42,172,101,103,106,188,107,143,56,4,218,228,191,165,230,177,183,113,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
