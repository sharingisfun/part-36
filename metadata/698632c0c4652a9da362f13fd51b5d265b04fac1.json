Meanwhile, a girl on the Baltic coast awaits her petÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return. Intensely imagistic, the nearly dialogue-free film includes a thrilling action sequence staged between the recovering pigeon and a neighborhood cat. Jan Ã„Å’uÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ­ksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning black-and-white cinematography favors high-contrast compositions between sea and sand, cityscape and sky. One of the key films in the emerging cinematic sensibility of the 1960s that would coalesce into the Czech New Wave by the decadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end.
