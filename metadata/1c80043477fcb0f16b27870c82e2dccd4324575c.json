Veteran blues singer Joe Turner and his usual rhythm section of the mid-'70s (which includes guitarist Pee Wee Crayton) are joined by four notable trumpeters: Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge, Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, and Clark Terry. On three blues (including the 15-minute &quot;I Know You Love Me Baby&quot;) and &quot;Tain't Nobody's Bizness If I Do,&quot; the group stretches out with each of the trumpeters getting ample solo space. It is not a classic outing (a little more planning and better material might have helped), but it is colorful and unique enough to be easily recommended to straight-ahead jazz and blues fans. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c80043477fcb0f16b27870c82e2dccd4324575c","amp;dn":"Trumpet+Kings+Meet+Joe+Turner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c80043477fcb0f16b27870c82e2dccd4324575c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,128,4,52,119,252,176,241,107,39,135,12,130,226,220,205,67,36,87,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
