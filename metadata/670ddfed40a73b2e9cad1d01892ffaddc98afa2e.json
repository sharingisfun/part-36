The sound quality is perhaps not quite as good the official Bootleg Series Vol. 4, but its close. And the performances are even better: Check out Like A Rolling Stone and I Dont Believe You for sheer explosiveness.  - On disc 1 is a few tracks from Dylans film of the tour, Eat The Document, which I will upload at some point soon.\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-g13D.html&quot;&gt;More info&lt;/A&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nNote: This is an mp4 encode of A Nightly Ritual.
