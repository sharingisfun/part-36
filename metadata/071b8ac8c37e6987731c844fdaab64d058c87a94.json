It is a stream capture and credit should go to the broadcaster BeSweeet (BS). Not sure if the other source LP2008 will continue to do the races. He is having a time with YouTube (been there) and if he returns, I will upload the work. I have stated that this is below usual standards so don't bitch cause I clearly told you what the file is. This is for the people who have no other option to see the race at this time. I am not sure I will continue to do the races myself if LP2008 is not an option. Just a heads up folks. \n\n\n\nPlease seed at full speed during and after download so that others can also enjoy and be sure to check out other CARG releases.\n\n\n\nFile Type: Mp4\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1/2 Video (mpgv)\nResolution: 672x352\nFrame Rate: 50\nAudio Codec: MPEG Audio layer 1/2/3 (mpga)\nChannels: Stereo\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nRun Time: Approximately 3 hrs \nAir Date: 10/06/2013\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nFor another helpful &quot;Racing related&quot; download location try this : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.wiziwig.eu/threads/21744-Full-Race-Downloads/page210&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.wiziwig.eu/threads/21744-Full-Race-Downloads/page210&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBackups and other CARG Releases can be found at ExtraTorrent, KickassTorrent and The Pirate Bay\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071b8ac8c37e6987731c844fdaab64d058c87a94","amp;dn":"NASCAR+2013+Cup+Series+%2330+Kansas+STREAM+CAPTURE+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071b8ac8c37e6987731c844fdaab64d058c87a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,27,138,200,195,126,105,135,115,28,132,79,218,171,100,208,88,200,122,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
