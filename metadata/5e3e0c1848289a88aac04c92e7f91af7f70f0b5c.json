The brilliant SmartGame, now also as App!\n\nOne of the best puzzle games is now finally available as an App, including 96 brand new challenges. \n\nLaunch the lifeboats, patrol the water and rescue all the passengers who've gone overboard! Titanic by SmartGames is a fascinating sliding puzzle with simple rules but with challenges that are surprisingly hard to solve.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nMove your lifeboats in such a way that all drowning passengers can climb in and be saved. When a sloop passes by someone in the water, the drowning man will of course save himself. \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this aspect that makes the gameplay particularly interesting, because it requires strategic insight to see which passenger has to be picked up by which particular lifeboat AND in what order this should happen. \n\nThis last part is crucial, as once the lifeboat is full it must remain anchored to the spot. So, from that moment on, the fully-boarded boat becomes an obstacle for other possible rescue work. This makes Titanic a constantly changing maze of people and boats.\n\nABOUT THE APP TITANIC (HD)\n\nThis App is based on the physical logic game &quot;Titanic&quot; from SmartGames and includes 96 new challenges and 4 levels of difficulty. \n\nThere is also a lite version of this app with 21 free challenges. Rescuing passengers starts out Ã¢â‚¬Ëœeasy,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ but becomes the more and more difficult, until players reach the Ã¢â‚¬ËœextremeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ level.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartgameslive.titanichd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartgameslive.titanichd&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3e0c1848289a88aac04c92e7f91af7f70f0b5c","amp;dn":"Titanic+by+SmartGames+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3e0c1848289a88aac04c92e7f91af7f70f0b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,62,12,24,72,40,154,136,170,192,76,146,231,249,26,247,247,15,11,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
