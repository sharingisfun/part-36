He next emerged on record on December 30, 1957, for a Pacific Jazz set with local musicians including his two brothers, vibraphonist Buddy and electric bassist Monk. This CD reissues the complete album (which usually has appeared in piecemeal fashion) and finds Wes already quite recognizable. The pretty standard hard bop music (which usually features Buddy's vibes as the lead voice) is also of interest due to the presence of trumpeter Freddie Hubbard who at age 17 was making his recording debut; he sounds a bit nervous.  In addition to this set, the CD has three songs from the one session that Wes made with his brothers' popular group, the Mastersounds.  He actually appeared on the full album (a set of music taken from the film Kismet) but these are the only titles that include guitar solos.  Although this reissue on a whole is not essential, the music is generally enjoyable and the CD will fill some gaps in one's Wes Montgomery collection. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nWes Montgomery (Guitar) \nFreddie Hubbard (Trumpet) - 1-4 \nWayman Atkinson (Tenor Saxophone) - 1-4 \nBuddy Montgomery (Vibraphone) - 1-6,8-10 \nAlonzo Johnson (Tenor Saxophone) - 1-4 \nJoe Bradley (Piano) - 1-5,7 \nMonk Montgomery (Bass Guitar) \nPaul Parker (Drums) - 1-7 \nRichie Crabtree (Piano) - 8-10 \nBenny Barth (Drums) - 8-10 \n\nWes Montgomery - Fingerpickin'  Tracks:\n01  Sound Carrier (Buddy Montgomery) 6:57 \n02  Bud's Beaux Arts (Buddy Montgomery) 7:33 \n03  Bock to Bock (Buddy Montgomery) 10:08 \n04  Billie's Bounce (Charlie Parker) 4:42 \n05  Lois Ann (Buddy Montgomery) 4:45 \n06  All the Things You Are (Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein II) 3:59 \n07  Fingerpickin' (Wes Montgomery) 2:32 \n08  Stranger in Paradise (Alexander Borodin/George Forrest/Robert C.
