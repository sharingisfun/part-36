(Marcel Dekker, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nHelping you keep pace with rapid developments in the field, Textile Sizing documents the rapidly changing scenario in textile processing and research in sizing. The authors analyze new fibers, spinning methods, and weaving techniques affecting textile production and studies the impact of fiber properties, yarn quality, sizing processes and materials, and chemical and mechanical phenomena on efficient textile manufacturing and development.\r\n\r\nNumerous tables dispersed throughout the text provide specific guidance on the wide range of processes involved in textile sizing.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the necessity and value of sizing techniques in the modern textile industry, this reference helps you\r\n\r\nPredict the efficiency of their sizing methods\r\nMaster process controls, warping and sizing operations, and modern instrumentation techniques\r\nAnalyze developments in draw warping and system sizing for reduction of operating costs\r\nUnderstand the importance of desizing and its effect on size recovery and environmental pollution\r\nStudy the behavior of the warp during weaving and the structural differences between various yarns\r\n\r\nTextile Sizing is invaluable for physical, surface, colloid, textile, materials, polymer, plastics, and fiber chemists; industrial, manufacturing, textile, fiber, and composite engineers; and upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in these disciplines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6d9faa548896cee065c9b7a1c72ecf1764e675","amp;dn":"Textile+Sizing+-+David+Hall+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6d9faa548896cee065c9b7a1c72ecf1764e675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,109,159,170,84,136,150,206,224,101,201,183,161,199,46,207,23,100,230,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
