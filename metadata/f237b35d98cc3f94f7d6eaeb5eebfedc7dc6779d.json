When a look holds more energy and sexuality than you have experienced in what seems like a lifetime? You follow the lead. In the middle of the night on a downtown train, Erin, in her mid-twenties, sits alone in her own world. She is in desperate need of a change, something to shake up her solitary existence. In walks the catalyst. Transit is a snapshot look at attraction, risk, and desire, an exploration of what comes next when a look can hold everything or nothing. \n\nEnjoy the simple pleasures of lesbian cruising, subway style!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f237b35d98cc3f94f7d6eaeb5eebfedc7dc6779d","amp;dn":"Transit+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f237b35d98cc3f94f7d6eaeb5eebfedc7dc6779d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,55,179,93,152,204,63,148,247,214,234,235,94,235,254,220,125,198,119,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
