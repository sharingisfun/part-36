Gray (Nova, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nPolystyrene is a common thermoplastic polymer made from the aromatic monomer styrene with good formability. It is widely used in automotive, electrical and electronic connector systems. This book presents current research in the study of polystyrene, including polystyrene attrition during chemical engineering processes; the biodegradability of polystyrene; the role of adhesion mechanisms of particles on modified polypropylene; direct fluorination of polystyrene; the applications of polystyrene into various sensing platforms; electrospun polystyrene fibers and superhydrophobic surfaces and the synthesis of end-functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b65cc359dea268d76375092c01ccfe0749ea9ca1","amp;dn":"Polystyrene+-+Properties%2C+Performance%2C+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b65cc359dea268d76375092c01ccfe0749ea9ca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,92,195,89,222,162,104,215,99,117,9,44,1,204,254,7,73,234,156,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
