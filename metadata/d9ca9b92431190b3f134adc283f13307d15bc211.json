Overgrow.com was home to the finest Marijuana GrowFAQ available \non the Internet and it too went dark along with its host. Fortunately, Google had a decent cache of the Overgrow GrowFAQ data, minus the full sized images. Programmers around the globe started work on recovering the GrowFAQ along with the famous Strain Guide. \n\nDue to these consolidated efforts, 90%+ of the original GrowFAQ &amp; OGSG have been\nrecovered. Several versions of the overgrow library have been released to the public in the last several years, all of them with varying degrees of accuracy and authenticity. This release, 033009, marks the culmination of 2 years of effort transforming this resource into an offline ebook. The content has been painstakingly editted to reflect current cannabis cultivation methods and new tutorials, guides, and resources have been added seamlessly into it. \n\nDepending on the response, new updates and revisions may be released as often as\ntwice a year. \n\n\n~~ Release Notes ~~\n\nThe Overgrow GrowFAQ is a collection of 1800 guides, tutorials, and answers\nto questions relating to cannabis cultivation. It contains everything from how\nto build stealth grow rooms, buying seeds online, using CFLs and HIDs, and just\nabout anything you ever wanted to know about growing cannabis. \n\nThe Overgrow Strain Guide (OGSG) is a collection of 2100 marijuana seed strain\nreviews, testimonials, and details. It contains partial reviews of nearly every\nseed strain and breeder. Unfortunately, the pictures of each strain have never\nbeen recovered and the developers working on this release didn't have time to \nhunt down photos for them all. \n\nThe GrowFAQ Tools application provided with this installation gives users a\nquick and simple way to add new items into the GrowFAQ and search all the articles\nwithout having to have a web server. The tools are provided with no warranty with no support.\n\n~~ Changes ~~\n\n* Fixed strain guide so the full breeder statement &amp; reviews are available\n* Added several new articles\n* Added GrowFAQ Tools appllication into release\n* Created InstallShield installer package\n* Cleaned up articles, added CSS index\n* Fixed Add New Article bug\n \n\nIF YOU ENJOY THIS RELEASE, PLEASE DONATE TO MARC EMERY AND ASSIST\nIN HIS FIGHT AGAINST BEING EXTRADITED TO THE USA FOR PROSECUTION \nBY THE D.E.A. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/4639.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/4639.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n~~ Screenshots ~~ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/AssChin79/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/AssChin79/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ca9b92431190b3f134adc283f13307d15bc211","amp;dn":"GrowFAQ-Marijuana+Growers+Encyclopedia.033009-Installer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ca9b92431190b3f134adc283f13307d15bc211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,202,155,146,67,17,144,179,241,52,173,194,131,241,51,7,209,91,194,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
