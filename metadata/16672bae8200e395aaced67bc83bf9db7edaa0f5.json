Speedy, nimble and formidably armed, frigates often operated independently, unlike the larger ships of the line. Legendary sailors such as Edward Pellew and Charles-Alexandre LÃƒÂ©on Durand, Comte de Linoise, found that commanding such a ship offered numerous opportunities for wealth. In this book, four representative frigate duels are examined: first, a battle fought between two closely matched ships (HMS Nymphe (36) vs La ClÃƒÂ©opÃƒÂ¢tre (32); second, a victory won by an inferior British frigate over a superior French frigate (HMS Pallas (32) vs Minerve (40); third, a victory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the only one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by an inferior French frigate over a superior British frigate (HMS Ambuscade (32) vs BaÃƒÂ¯onnaise (24), and fourth, victory of a superior British frigate over an inferior French frigate (HMS Indefatigable (44) of Hornblower fame vs La Virginie (40). Featuring specially commissioned artwork and offering expert analysis, this study provides a vivid account of the bloody combats fought by the most romantic warship of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic era Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the frigate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16672bae8200e395aaced67bc83bf9db7edaa0f5","amp;dn":"British+Frigate+VS+French+Frigate+1793-1814+%28Naval+History+Ospre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16672bae8200e395aaced67bc83bf9db7edaa0f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,103,43,174,130,0,227,149,170,206,214,123,200,59,249,219,126,218,160,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
