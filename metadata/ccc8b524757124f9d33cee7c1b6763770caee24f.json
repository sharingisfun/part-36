Mel Ferrer is the lame and embittered puppeteer she loves and fears. The title song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, is as poignant as ever. This edition is from the recently released WarnerArchive DVD, which has been remastered and corrected the faulty registration seen in airing on TCM the last few years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc8b524757124f9d33cee7c1b6763770caee24f","amp;dn":"Lili","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc8b524757124f9d33cee7c1b6763770caee24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,200,181,36,117,113,36,249,211,60,238,124,27,103,99,119,12,174,226,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
