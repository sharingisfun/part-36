Legitimate and black-market economies rule the City, overseen by the vying factions of the Yakuza and Porno Swede crime families. Convenience store clerkette and 16-year-old suburban wise-ass Pella Suzuki suddenly finds herself in the middle of it all, heir to an empire she couldn't possibly inherit, but hitmen on both sides aren't taking any chances. Supermarket is anti-consumerism with a healthy dose of violence and humor.\n\nWritten by Brian Wood and illustrated by Kristian Donaldson.
