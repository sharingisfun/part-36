Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators? Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies but against those who needed him most - and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world's motor - and the motive power of every man? This novel presents a panorama of human life - from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy... to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction... to the philosopher who becomes a pirate... to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad... to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8466f12337db7cd0ac5f9ea5d8edbe0858c086ce","amp;dn":"Rand_Ayn-Atlas_Shrugged.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8466f12337db7cd0ac5f9ea5d8edbe0858c086ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,102,241,35,55,219,124,208,172,95,158,165,216,237,190,8,88,192,134,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
