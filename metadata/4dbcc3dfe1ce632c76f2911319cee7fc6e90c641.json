We incorporate numeric and text string search, advanced relational page navigation methods, table handling, and user defined rules that help define relationships between HTML content. It is even possible to open PDF attachments on a website and search them as if they were web pages.\n\nKey Benefits\nAutomated Collection \t\n* Functions as a universal web connecter\n* Robots executable by users or applications\n* Easy-to-use visual scripting\nETL for the Web \t\n* Powerful data extraction capabilities\n* Rich data modeling and transformation\n* Support for all major databases\nSelf-Service Platform \t\n* Complete control of all software\n* Develop and maintain your own robots\n* Integrates well with popular middleware\n\nAccess Any Data\n\nIn addition to internal databases, valuable business data often resides as web-based content or in other semi-structured or unstructured forms, such as PDF documents, Excel spreadsheets, or XML files. Because these data sources are not structured, they do not have APIs to enable access and reuse, locking out important sources of data for applications and users.\n\nThe Data Collection Edition allows you to access all of these data types, using our powerful visual scripting environment. Web content and data that you collect can then be written to a database, published as a web service, or transformed into a format suitable for use by other applications. And, to enable the execution of robots from with your Java or .NET applications, we provide a full set of C# and Java APIs for developers.\n\n\nSerial Included.\n\n/*It's always good to say thank you*/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbcc3dfe1ce632c76f2911319cee7fc6e90c641","amp;dn":"Kapow+Tech+Mashup+Server+6.4+%5BFormerly+Robosuite%5D+-+Data+Collect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbcc3dfe1ce632c76f2911319cee7fc6e90c641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,188,195,223,225,206,99,44,118,242,145,19,25,206,231,252,110,144,198,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
