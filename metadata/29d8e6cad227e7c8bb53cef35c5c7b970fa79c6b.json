The remaining population are the\r\nFactionless, who have no status or privilege in this society. When children\r\nreach the age of 16, they undergo a serum-induced psychological test which\r\nindicates their best-suited faction, then are allowed to choose any faction\r\nas their permanent group at the subsequent Choosing Ceremony.\r\n\r\nBeatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) was born into Abnegation, which runs the\r\ngovernment. Her father, Andrew Prior (Tony Goldwyn) serves on the ruling\r\ncouncil along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson)\r\nBeatrice takes her test with a Dauntless woman named Tori Wu (Maggie Q) as\r\nher proctor. Her results show attributes of multiple factions, meaning she is\r\nDivergent. Her divergence includes Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless. Tori\r\nrecords her results as Abnegation and warns her to keep the true result a\r\nsecret, saying that because Divergents can think independently and the\r\ngovernment therefore cannot control them, they are considered threats to\r\nthe existing social order.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $85,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $54,607,747 (USA) (21 March 2014)\r\nGross: $150,832,203 (USA) (4 July 2014)\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/62574409083379816841.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/05880515671143441725.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/99649158416604835951.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/25593776639118845766.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/04967502231362600276.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/44213462163262339808.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1840309/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 11.2 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:19:41\r\nSample: No\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS\r\nAudio Bit rate: 1509 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / 16 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 6 channels 5.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d8e6cad227e7c8bb53cef35c5c7b970fa79c6b","amp;dn":"Divergent+-+%5B2014%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d8e6cad227e7c8bb53cef35c5c7b970fa79c6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,216,230,202,210,39,231,200,187,83,206,243,92,92,123,151,15,167,156,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
