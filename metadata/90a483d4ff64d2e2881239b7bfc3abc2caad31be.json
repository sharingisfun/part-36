Though a few of his singles -- &quot;Rubber Ball,&quot; for one -- were as innocuous as anything else from the era, Vee had a knack for infectious Brill Building pop, thanks to his ebullient voice as well as the cadre of songwriters standing behind him.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vee-p5750/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vee-p5750/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nThe reissue of this enjoyable album includes ten bonus tracks, including alternate takes, unreleased songs, and the &quot;Buddy Holly Medley,&quot; a recent recording by Vee And The Crickets.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/bobby-vee-meets-the-crickets-r21066&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/bobby-vee-meets-the-crickets-r21066&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DRC7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DRC7&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
