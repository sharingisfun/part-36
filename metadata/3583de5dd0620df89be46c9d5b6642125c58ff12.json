There are countless statements calling for the murdering, raping, torturing, throat-cutting, frying, hanging, electrocution, burning, and rotting in hell of Amanda, along with her sisters, family, friends, and supporters.\n\nWhy?\n\nTrial By Fury explores this dark netherworld, identifying the people involved, and investigating their motives. It documents the real-world damage caused by these anonymous bloggers, including how they managed to get a much decorated ex-FBI agent fired from his job. It also recounts the story of the Wikipedia entry about the case, which triggered a spectacular brawl among top wiki-editors, leading to outings, rants, bannings-for-life, and death threats, requiring the intervention of Jimmy Wales himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3583de5dd0620df89be46c9d5b6642125c58ff12","amp;dn":"Trial+by+Fury+-+Douglas+Preston.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3583de5dd0620df89be46c9d5b6642125c58ff12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,131,222,93,208,98,13,248,155,228,108,157,91,102,66,18,92,88,255,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
