It didn't take long for him to get an answer. \n\n&quot;I fell for his songs,&quot; says Fortus. &quot;Right then and there I decided that I wanted to be a part of this. He's got some really unique and amazing rock songs.&quot; \n\nThe American guitarist, who has been a member of GUNS N' ROSES since 2002, took a break from his main gig to visit TromsÃƒÂ¸, northern Norway, where he and Kvernmo spent the days writing new material. \n\nOn October 2, the first single from SÃƒï¿½IVU, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, was released as a preview of what's to come on the project's debut album, &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;. The recordings were done in Los Angeles with producer Ben Grosse (MARILYN MANSON, DEPECHE MODE, MADONNA). Drummer Will Hunt (EVANESCENCE, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY) and guitarist Geno Lenardo (FILTER, CHEVELLE) also appear on the CD. \n\n&quot;SÃƒÂ¡ivu&quot; is a word from Sami mythology. SÃƒÂ¡ivu is considered to be a place where the dead forefathers reside Ã¢â‚¬â€ a place where everything is bigger, more beautiful and better than the world of the living.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7d1e3d708292942f2b9cce31f10226243d640f","amp;dn":"SAIVU+-+GOODBYE+2012+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7d1e3d708292942f2b9cce31f10226243d640f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,125,30,61,112,130,146,148,47,43,156,206,49,241,2,38,36,61,100,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
