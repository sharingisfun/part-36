It is an adaptation by Bill Naughton of his own novel and play of the same name. The film was released by Paramount Pictures.\n\nThe film tells the story of a young man who leads a promiscuous lifestyle until several life reversals make him rethink his purposes and goals in life. Alfie frequently breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera narrating and justifying his actions. His words often contrast and/or totally contradict his actions.\n\nThe films begins with Alfie Elkins (Caine) ending a relationship with a married woman and getting another of his affairs pregnant. The film then follows his life for a few years, documenting events that lead to the character's emotional growth starting with the birth of his child.\n\nWatching his child grow brings out a more caring side of Alfie, including his having a health check in case of hereditary diseases, but his inability to commit to the child's mother leads to her marrying a bus conductor. The health check reveals Alfie has shadows on his lungs. This combined with being banned from seeing his son leads him to have a small breakdown.\n\n\n\nTerence Stamp turned down the role of &quot;Alfie&quot;. He recommended Caine for the role.\n\nThe film features music by noted jazz musician Sonny Rollins, backed by Kenny Burrell, Jimmy Cleveland, J.J. Johnson and Roger Kellaway arranged and conducted by Oliver Nelson.\n\nThe end credits are unusual in that not only photos of the principal actors are featured, but also the main technical crew, including director Lewis Gilbert and cameraman Otto Heller.\n\n\n\nDirected by \tLewis Gilbert\n\nProduced by \tLewis Gilbert\n\nWritten by \tBill Naughton\n\nStarring \tMichael Caine\n                Shelley Winters\n                Millicent Martin\n                Vivien Merchant\n\nMusic by \tSonny Rollins\n\nCinematograph \tOtto Heller\n\nEditing by \tThelma Connell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 49mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 897 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7038191718303c435e41&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 734 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 432 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate               : 24.987 fps\nMaximum frame rate               : 25.013 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.094\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : LC\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 262 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\n\n\nJacket &amp; DVD @600dpi\n\n\nPlayback Problems? &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89946ea2e600f8e411e9880a2e7984924c4ec9d7","amp;dn":"Alfie+1966+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89946ea2e600f8e411e9880a2e7984924c4ec9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,148,110,162,230,0,248,228,17,233,136,10,46,121,132,146,76,78,201,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
