Interviewed just days after the death of his beloved father, he speaks of his parents' influence on him and his own role as an often-absent father of four. Steven reflects on ex-wives and ex-girlfriends, the feuds with bandmates that almost destroyed Aerosmith, his decades-long struggles with addiction, and what he really thinks of the man he replaced on American Idol, Simon Cowell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:047429560237d7a84441b1ddd2dd4a53aa36b1e1","amp;dn":"Oprahs.Next.Chapter.S01E01.Steven.Tyler.HDTV.reencode.xvid.telly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"047429560237d7a84441b1ddd2dd4a53aa36b1e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,116,41,86,2,55,215,168,68,65,177,221,210,221,74,83,170,54,177,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
