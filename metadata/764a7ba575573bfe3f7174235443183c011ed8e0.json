I'm Casey Kasem and the countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA listener writes in asking this: &quot;You sometimes mention the songs that drop off the chart from the week before. I've kept track and noticed that they usually drop out of the 30's and sometimes the 20's but never higher. I want to know the highest position that a record ever dropped from, and what was the song?&quot; Casey says the song in question went from number 1 to number 18, and then completely off the hot 100 back in 1969.\n\nCasey tells what song hit the chart in two different versions with the longest span of time between them.\n\n&quot;Do You Want To Dance&quot; (at number 25) by Bette Midler is a remake. Bobby Freeman recorded the original, and Casey plays a portion of it.\n\nThere is a hit by two artists who quit using the instruments they played on the number one song &quot;Tequila,&quot; and switched to new instruments because of their religious beliefs.\n\nA listener has this to say, &quot;Dear Casey, You said that Roberta Flack was the first female singer in a long time to have 2 number one hits in a row. Who was the last male singer to do it? Was it Elvis Presley?&quot; Casey says the last time was 10 years prior, it wasn't Elvis, and the artist did it with 2 remakes.\n\n40:    Daisy A Day - Jud Strunk\n39:    A Letter To Myself - The Chi-Lites\n38:    One Less Set Of Footprints - Jim Croce        \n37:    Good Morning Heartache - Diana Ross     \n36:    Cook With Honey - Judy Collins     \n35:    Hello Hurray - Alice Cooper    \n34:    Master Of Eyes - Aretha Franklin\n33:    Give Me Your Love - Barbara Mason\n32:    Little Willie - The Sweet\n31:    Kissing My Love - Bill Withers\n30:    Peaceful - Helen Reddy\n29:    The Twelfth Of Never - Donny Osmond    \n28:    Rocky Mountain High - John Denver\n27:    Crocodile Rock - Elton John\n26:    Cisco Kid - War\n25:    Do You Want To Dance - Bette Midler\n24:    Stir It Up - Johnny Nash\n23:    Big City Miss Ruth Ann - Gallery\n22:    Masterpiece - The Temptations\n21:    Hummingbird - Seals &amp; Crofts\n20:    Space Oddity - David Bowie\n19:    Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree - Dawn\n18:    Daddy's Home - Jermaine Jackson\n17:    Dead Skunk - Loudon Wainwright Iii\n16:    The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia - Vicki Lawrence\n15:    Aubrey - Bread\n14:    Could It Be I'm Falling In Love - The Spinners\n13:    Call Me (Come Back Home) - Al Green\n12:    I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band) - The Moody Blues\n11:    Sing - The Carpenters\n10:    Ain't No Woman (Like The One I've Got) - The Four Tops\n9:    Break Up To Make Up - The Stylistics\n8:    Danny's Song - Anne Murray\n7:    Dueling Banjos - Deliverance\n6:    The Cover Of Rolling Stone - Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show\n5:    Last Song - Edward Bear\n4:    Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye) - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n3:    Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001) - Deodato\n2:    Killing Me Softly With His Song - Roberta Flack\n1:    Love Train - The O'Jays","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:764a7ba575573bfe3f7174235443183c011ed8e0","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_March_24th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"764a7ba575573bfe3f7174235443183c011ed8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,74,123,165,117,87,59,254,63,113,116,35,84,67,24,60,1,30,216,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
