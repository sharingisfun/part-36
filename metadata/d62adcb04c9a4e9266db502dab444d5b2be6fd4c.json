The first single &quot;We Weren't Born To Follow&quot; is the fastest growing single in the band's HISTORY, and the fastest growing ever on the Hot AC chart. Also included is the groundbreaking band documentary When We Were Beautiful. Filmed while the band was on its unprecedented Lost Highway world tour, this is the first intimate look at this legendary group. Unlike the usual band documentary, When We Were Beautiful reveals the inner workings and unique personalities that have made Bon Jovi one of the most successful rock groups of all time.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62adcb04c9a4e9266db502dab444d5b2be6fd4c","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+The+Circle+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62adcb04c9a4e9266db502dab444d5b2be6fd4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,42,220,176,76,154,78,146,102,219,80,45,171,68,77,91,43,230,253,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
