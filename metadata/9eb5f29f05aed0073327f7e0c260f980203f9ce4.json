The result is a fascinating range  of classic animated entertainment. Here are old favorite characters from Disney and Warner Bros., the imaginatively offbeat creations of the Fleischer studio, pioneering efforts from early masters like Winsor McCay and Otto Messmer, and many more, including Walter Lantz, MGM, and others.\n\nA portrait of each winning cartoon includes a plot summary, the production history, and a critical analysis that explores the unique qualities that have earned the cartoon a place in film history. Also included are interviews with the\nactual artists, as well as sidebars throughout the book that focus on individual characters, animators, directors, and studios. In addition, major writers in the field of animation Ã¢â‚¬â€ Leonard Maltin.John Canemaker, Joe Adamson, Steve Schneider, Charles Solomon, and Leslie Cabarga Ã¢â‚¬â€ comment on their favorite films. And hundreds of illustrations culled from private and public collections across America display every stage of the animators' art, from the first pencil sketches to frame enlargements from the finished work.\n\nFor many readers, The Fifty Greatest Cartoons is a long-overdue acknowledgment of an overlooked art form. Brimming with lively text and vivid images, this is a nostalgic look at old friends and childhood pleasures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eb5f29f05aed0073327f7e0c260f980203f9ce4","amp;dn":"The+50+Greatest+Cartoons+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eb5f29f05aed0073327f7e0c260f980203f9ce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,181,242,159,5,174,208,7,51,39,247,224,194,96,249,128,32,63,156,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
