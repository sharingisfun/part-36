Ten years ago Navarre left town and the memory of his father's murder behind him. Now he's back, looking for answers. Yet the more Tres digs, trying to put his suspicions to rest, the fresher the decade-old crime looks: Mafia connections, construction site payoffs, and slick politicians' games all conspire to ruin his homecoming.\n\nIt's obvious Tres has stirred up a hornet's nest of trouble. He gets attacked, shot at, run over by a big blue ThunderbirdÃ¢â‚¬â€and his old girlfriend, the one he wants back, turns up missing. Tres has to rescue the woman, nail his father's murderer, and get the hell out of Dodge before mob-style Texas justice catches up to him. The chances of staying alive looked better for the defenders of the Alamo....\n\nand SIX more novels of the series together here in ePub format. Enjoy and do seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca36adec861a9b04955719b72286ffc8e8122093","amp;dn":"Rick+Riordan+-+Tres+Navarre+Series+Full+-+ePub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca36adec861a9b04955719b72286ffc8e8122093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,54,173,236,134,26,155,4,149,87,25,183,34,134,255,200,232,18,32,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
