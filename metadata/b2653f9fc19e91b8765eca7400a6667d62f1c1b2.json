What was the secret of Einstein's scientific creativity? Nova's two-hour special traces his extraordinary rise from a student who flunked his engineering exams to the world's most renowned physicist. This penetrating profile of a scientist who changed our vision of physical reality includes dramatic recreations and easy-to-understand animations of Einstein's landmark Theory of Relativity. Through Einstein's own words, learn how--after using his wife, Mileva, as a sounding board for his early theories--the young patent clerk abandons &quot;the unpredictability of human relations.&quot; Then, follow his ferocious quest to &quot;glimpse the order that lies hidden in nature&quot; -- a search that catapults him to the forefront of modern physics, but at great personal cost.&quot;\nNarrated by F. Murray Abraham.\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S24E01.-.Einstein.Revealed.mp4 (517MB, 1:50:34)\nResolution: 702x478 (native DVD), 4:3 aspect ratio\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.97fps\nSubtitles: None\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=25\nOriginally broadcast: 1996-Oct.-06\n\nNotes:\n\n- Already posted here ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6188597/Albert_Einstein_Revealed__%28Nova%29 ) but at 1.24GB is around 2.5x the size of this one.\n\n- Wikipedia calls this episode S23E11 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\n- Please seed to 100% or higher and do your part so free media will always be available.
