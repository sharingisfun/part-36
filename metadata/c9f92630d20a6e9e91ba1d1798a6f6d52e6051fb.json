A ruthless, fiercely loyal civil servant, Walsingham worked brilliantly behind the scenes to foil ElizabethÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rival Mary Queen of Scots and outwit Catholic Spain and France, which had arrayed their forces behind her. Though he cut an incongruous figure in ElizabethÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worldly court, Walsingham managed to win the trust of key players like William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester before launching his own secret campaign against the queenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enemies. Covert operations were WalsinghamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genius; he pioneered techniques for exploiting double agents, spreading disinformation, and deciphering codes with the latest code-breaking science that remain staples of international espionage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f92630d20a6e9e91ba1d1798a6f6d52e6051fb","amp;dn":"Her+Majesty%5C%27s+Spymaster%3A+Elizabeth+I%2C+Sir+Francis+Walsingham.ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f92630d20a6e9e91ba1d1798a6f6d52e6051fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,249,38,48,210,10,110,158,145,186,29,23,152,166,246,213,46,96,81,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
