However, Empire's digital releases switched from lo-res to hi-res between &quot;Fit the Fourth&quot; and &quot;Fit the Fifth&quot;, which corresponds to a marked and somewhat natural partitioning of the series into &quot;books&quot;, which is why you get three of those instead, on this occasion.\n\nFurther details: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.boom-studios.com/series/title?series_id=724&amp;name=Snarked&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.boom-studios.com/series/title?series_id=724&amp;name=Snarked&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95e880e194642a2daaa6935b5412a74cc1faaf3","amp;dn":"Snarked+%282011-12%2F2012+Eisner+Award+Recipient%29+%28Digital%29+%28Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f95e880e194642a2daaa6935b5412a74cc1faaf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,94,136,14,25,70,66,162,218,170,105,53,181,65,42,116,204,31,170,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
