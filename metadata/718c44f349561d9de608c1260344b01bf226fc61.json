If someone wrote songs like White Riot, Janie Jones, Police and Thieves, I Fought the Law, Complete Control, English Civil War, Tommy Gun, White Man in Hammersmith Palais, Hitsville U.K., The Magnificent Seven, Police On My Back, Should I Stay Or Should I Go, Train In Vain, Rock the Casbah, Garageland, Straight to Hell, Bankrobber, This is England and released a record like London Calling they kind off said it all themselfs. With 7 records they simply changed the rock music forever.\n\nSome people say rock music died 3th of February 1959 with the death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. Richardson (The Big Bopper) in a plane crash, other say it was 16th of August 1977 with Elvis but for me like for millions it was 22 of December 2002 when uncle Joe went from being just a rock musician here on earth to join his place amongst the Gods of rock. \n\n\nHere are all the releases plus the Super Black Market Clash. I put it in here instead of the first Black Market Clash since all the songs from the original ones are here on other records. \n\nBonuses are Guns of Brixton, a live record from 1979 and Burning London a tribute album with bands like No Doubt, Ice Cube and Mobby amongst many.\n\n\nThe Clash (red release)\nGive ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´em Enough Rope\nLondon Calling\nThe Guns of Brixton\nSandinista!\nCombat Rock\nCut the Crap\nSuper Black Market Clash\nClash On Broadway\nFrom Here To Eternity\n\nBurning London (tribute)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718c44f349561d9de608c1260344b01bf226fc61","amp;dn":"The+Clash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718c44f349561d9de608c1260344b01bf226fc61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,140,68,243,73,86,29,157,230,8,193,38,3,68,176,27,242,38,252,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
