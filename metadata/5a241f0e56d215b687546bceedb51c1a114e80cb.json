Vampires, Werewolves, the dead, demon cultists, six foot tall rabbit pookas, this story covers about all it's bases. sprinkled with pop culture referances, that give it that &quot;real&quot; feel lacking in far too many settings/stories, and with a good amount of humor. If you like Jim Butcher's Dresdin files, Mage is the game for you, and Penny Dreadful will be a fun read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a241f0e56d215b687546bceedb51c1a114e80cb","amp;dn":"Penny+Dreadful%3A+A+Mage%3A+the+Ascension+Novel+in+Eight+Parts+and+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a241f0e56d215b687546bceedb51c1a114e80cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,36,31,14,86,210,21,182,135,84,107,206,237,181,28,26,17,78,128,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
