Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fallen in with three truly insane survivors and has to ride the wave of lunacy to escape. But as her own crushing personal demons come crashing down, the temptation to indulge in the crazy becomes more tempting than another day in the Crossed world outside. These madmen arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hiders or scavengersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦they are the livers.\n\n\nAll credit goes to the original scanners!\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a34995f6a7ea450b4339c2a764de5a532d8f0f","amp;dn":"Crossed+-+Badlands+%2322+%28CBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a34995f6a7ea450b4339c2a764de5a532d8f0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,163,73,149,246,167,234,69,11,67,57,194,167,100,222,90,83,45,143,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
