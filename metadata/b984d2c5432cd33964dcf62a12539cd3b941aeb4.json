No evidence of that in these songs here though,\nwhich are the opposite and as I say, altogether an inspiration from the best\ngals in what is Christian ministry persuasion o the planet thus far! I \nhave great personal hopes that a secular Europe will do even better in teaching\nspirituality for a humanistic movement that will represent all that we are in\nthe near future.
