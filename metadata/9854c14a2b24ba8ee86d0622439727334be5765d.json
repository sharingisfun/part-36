Night after night they remind us of just how small we are, and how huge God is. Looking out into the far reaches of the universe, we find a seemingly infinite expanse of mystery and wonder, intricately fashioned by a God of unfathomable size and power. Just a glimpse of one of the billions of visible galaxies He has formed resizes us, shrinking us, and the world we call home, to seeming insignificance in an instant. But as tiny as we may seem, the God who knows every star by name also knows yours, and mine. And in the most stunning rescue imaginable, God sent His Son to this spinning planet we call home--the Creator reconnecting us to Himself with life that never ends.\n\nIndescribable takes us on an image-rich journey through the cosmos, allowing us to peer into God&amp;#039;s universe to discover the amazing magnitude of His greatness and grace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9854c14a2b24ba8ee86d0622439727334be5765d","amp;dn":"Indescribable+-+Louie+Giglio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9854c14a2b24ba8ee86d0622439727334be5765d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,84,193,74,43,36,186,142,232,109,6,34,67,151,39,51,75,229,118,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
