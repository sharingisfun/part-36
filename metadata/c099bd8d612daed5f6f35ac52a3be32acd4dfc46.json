Later they burst into Asia Minor and Rome's Danube provinces, becoming famous for the prowess of their lance-armed cavalry - first as enemies, and later as allies of Rome. They influenced Rome's adoption of heavy armoured cavalry, and in Roman service they were even posted to Britain. Drawing upon a wide reading of Classical authors and of Russian archaeological publications, this fascinating study is the first major English language attempt to reconstruct their armour, equipment and tactics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c099bd8d612daed5f6f35ac52a3be32acd4dfc46","amp;dn":"The+Sarmatians%3A+600+BC-AD+450","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c099bd8d612daed5f6f35ac52a3be32acd4dfc46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,153,189,141,97,45,174,213,246,243,90,197,42,59,227,42,205,77,252,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
