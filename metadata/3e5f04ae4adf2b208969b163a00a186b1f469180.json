Long, Andrea Noble, Edward Welch\n\n2009 | ISBN: 0415477069, 0415477077 | 192 pages | epub, PDF | 2,4 + 6,5 MB\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nOver the past twenty-five years, photography has moved to centre-stage in the study of visual culture and has established itself in numerous disciplines. This trend has brought with it a diversification in approaches to the study of the photographic image.\n\nPhotography: Theoretical Snapshots offers exciting perspectives on photography theory today from some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading critics and theorists. \n\nIt introduces new means of looking at photographs, with topics including:\n\n-a community-based understanding of Spencer TunickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s controversial installations\n-the tactile and auditory dimensions of photographic viewing\n-snapshot photography\n-the use of photography in human rights discourse.\n\n\nPhotography: Theoretical Snapshots also addresses the question of photography history, revisiting the work of some of the most influential theorists such as Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, and the October group, re-evaluating the neglected genre of the carte-de-visite photograph, and addressing photographyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wider role within the ideologies of modernity. The collection opens with an introduction by the editors, analyzing the trajectory of photography studies and theory over the past three decades and the ways in which the discipline has been constituted.\n\nRanging from the most personal to the most dehumanized uses of photography, from the nineteenth century to the present day, from Latin America to Northern Europe, Photography: Theoretical Snapshots will be of value to all those interested in photography, visual culture, and cultural history.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5f04ae4adf2b208969b163a00a186b1f469180","amp;dn":"Photography+-+Theoretical+Snapshots%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5f04ae4adf2b208969b163a00a186b1f469180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,95,4,174,74,223,43,32,137,105,177,99,160,10,24,107,31,70,145,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
