We are leaking over 38,000 private emails which\ncontain detailed computer forensics techniques, investigation protocols as well\nas highly embarrassing personal information. We are confident these gifts will \nbring smiles to the faces of our black hat brothers and sisters (especially \nthose who have been targeted by these scurvy dogs) while also making a mockery \nof &quot;security professionals&quot; who whore their &quot;skills&quot; to law enforcement to \nprotect tyrannical corporativism and the status quo we aim to destroy.\n\nWe hijacked two gmail accounts belonging to Fred Baclagan, who has been a cop\nfor 20 years, dumping his private email correspondence as well as several dozen \nvoicemails and SMS text message logs. While just yesterday Fred was having a \nprivate BBQ with his CATCHTEAM high computer crime task force friends, we were \nreviewing their detailed internal operation plans and procedure documents. We \nalso couldn't overlook the boatloads of embarrassing personal information about \nour cop friend Fred. We lulzed as we listened to angry voicemails from his \nestranged wives and ex-girlfriends while also reading his conversations with \ngirls who responded to his &quot;man seeking woman&quot; craigslist ads. We turned on his \ngoogle web history and watched him look up linux command line basics, golfing \ntutorials, and terrible youtube music videos. We also abused his google \nvoice account, making sure Fred's friends and family knew how hard he was owned.\n\nPossibly the most interesting content in his emails are the IACIS.com internal\nemail list archives (2005-2011) which detail the methods and tactics cybercrime \nunits use to gather electronic evidence, conduct investigations and make \narrests. The information in these emails will prove essential to those who want \nto protect themselves from the techniques and procedures cyber crime \ninvestigators use to build cases. If you have ever been busted for computer \ncrimes, you should check to see if your case is being discussed here. There are \ndiscussions about using EnCase forensic software, attempts to crack TrueCrypt \nencrypted drives, sniffing wireless traffic in mobile surveillance vehicles, how \nto best prepare search warrants and subpoenas, and a whole lot of clueless \npeople asking questions on how to use basic software like FTP. In the end, we\nrickrolled the entire IACIS list, causing the administrators to panic and shut\ntheir list and websites down.\n\nThese cybercrime investigators are supposed to be the cream of the crop, but we\nreveal the totality of their ignorance of all matters related to computer\nsecurity. For months, we have owned several dozen white hat and law enforcement\ntargets-- getting in and out of whichever high profile government and corporate\nsystem we please and despite all the active FBI investigations and several\nbillion dollars of funding, they have not been able to stop us or get anywhere\nnear us. Even worse, they bust a few dozen people who are allegedly part of an\n&quot;anonymous computer hacking conspiracy&quot; but who have only used \nkindergarten-level DDOS tools-- this isn't even hacking, but a form of\nelectronic civil disobedience. \n\nWe often hear these &quot;professionals&quot; preach about &quot;full-disclosure,&quot; but we are\nsure these people are angrily sending out DMCA takedown notices and serving\nsubpoenas as we speak. They call us criminals, script kiddies, and terrorists, \nbut their entire livelihood depends on us, trying desperately to study our \ntechniques and failing miserably at preventing future attacks. See we're cut \nfrom an entirely different kind of cloth. Corporate security professionals like\nThomas Ryan and Aaron Barr think they're doing something noble by &quot;leaking&quot; the\npublic email discussion lists of Occupy Wall Street and profiling the &quot;leaders&quot;\nof Anonymous. Wannabe player haters drop shitty dox and leak partial chat logs\nabout other hackers, doing free work for law enforcement. Then you got people \nlike Peiter &quot;Mudge&quot; Zatko who back in the day used to be old school l0pht/cDc \nonly now to sell out to DARPA going around to hacker conventions encouraging \nothers to work for the feds. Let this be a warning to aspiring white hat \n&quot;hacker&quot; sellouts and police collaborators: stay out the game or get owned and \nexposed. You want to keep mass arresting and brutalizing the 99%? We'll have to \nkeep owning your boxes and torrenting your mail spools, plastering your personal \ninformation all over teh internets.\n\nHackers, join us and rise up against our common oppressors - the white hats, the \n1%'s 'private' police, the corrupt banks and corporations and make 2011 the year \nof leaks and revolutions! \n\nWe are Anti-Security,\nWe are the 99%\nWe do not forgive.\nWe do not forget.\nExpect Us!\n\n################################################################################\n   \n   [*] Browse the emails using Tor Hidden Services:\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://ibhg35kgdvnb7jvw.onion/cybercrime&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ibhg35kgdvnb7jvw.onion/cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;           &lt;- on tor\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://ibhg35kgdvnb7jvw.tor2web.org/cybercrime&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ibhg35kgdvnb7jvw.tor2web.org/cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;- not on tor\n   \n   [*] Download the emails using BitTorrent:\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.thepiratebay.se/user/AntiSecurity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.thepiratebay.se/user/AntiSecurity&lt;/a&gt;\n       \n   [*] Donate BitCoins for future leaks!!   18NHixaoQekQJ3y52aBGJJwgBWX9X3myYR\n  \n################################################################################\n\n          ( full release text here: http://pastebin.com/NwN8ehFW )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd92856a4260a4525bf19d0f41157fe79d83b1b","amp;dn":"Fuck+FBI+Friday+V%3A+IACIS+Cybercrime+Investigators+Owned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd92856a4260a4525bf19d0f41157fe79d83b1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,217,40,86,164,38,10,69,37,191,25,208,244,17,87,254,121,216,59,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
