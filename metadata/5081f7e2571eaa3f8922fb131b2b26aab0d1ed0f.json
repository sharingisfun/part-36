This book discusses the properties of microscopic particles in nonlinear systems, principles of the nonlinear quantum mechanical theory, and its applications in condensed matter, polymers and biological systems. The book is essentially composed of three parts. The first part presents a review of linear quantum mechanics, as well as theoretical and experimental fundamentals that establish the nonlinear quantum mechanical theory. The theory itself and its essential features are covered in the second part. In the final part, extensive applications of this theory in physics, biology and polymer are introduced. The whole volume forms a complete system of nonlinear quantum mechanics. The book is intended for researchers, graduate students as well as upper-level undergraduates.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5081f7e2571eaa3f8922fb131b2b26aab0d1ed0f","amp;dn":"Quantum+Mechanics+in+Nonlinear+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5081f7e2571eaa3f8922fb131b2b26aab0d1ed0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,129,247,226,87,30,170,63,137,34,251,19,27,43,38,170,176,209,237,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
