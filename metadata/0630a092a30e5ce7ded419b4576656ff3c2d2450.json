His rawboned 1939-1942 Bluebird recordings were no-frills excursions into the blues bottoms. He left a powerful legacy that included &quot;Bottle It up and Go,&quot; &quot;Cross Cut Saw Blues,&quot; &quot;Deep Blue Sea Blues&quot; (aka &quot;Catfish Blues&quot;), and others whose lasting power has been evidenced through the repertoires and re-recordings of other artists. Admirers of McClennan's blues would do well to check out the 1941-1942 Bluebird sessions of Robert Petway, a McClennan associate who performed in a similar but somewhat more lyrical vein.\n\nMcClennan never recorded again and reportedly died destitute in Chicago; blues researchers have yet to even trace the date or circumstances of his death. \nA well-respected country blues artist despite his limited output, Robert Petway was a blues guitarist who recorded eight sides for Bluebird Records in 1941 and followed those up with eight more in 1942 (of which six were issued). Little biographical information is available on Petway, although it is known that he lived and played in Mississippi. The only surviving image of him shows him in overalls, holding a metal-bodied National resonator guitar. His song &quot;Catfish Blues&quot; gained some notoriety when it was recorded by Muddy Waters, who renamed it &quot;Rollin' Stone,&quot; providing the inspiration years later for the name of the rock band, the Rolling Stones. \n\nAlbum: Robert Petway &amp; Tommy McClennan Vol 1\nBitrate: 320K/s\nTime: 34:59\nSize: 80.1 MB\nLabel: Mbop Global-OvcMedia\nStyles: Acoustic Delta blues\nYear: 2009\nArt: Front\n\n[2:48] 1.
