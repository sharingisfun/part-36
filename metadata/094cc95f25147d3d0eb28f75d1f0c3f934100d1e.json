Despite the success of the single &quot;Creatures (For a While)&quot; (which reached #3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart) and positive reaction from their fanbase, Evolver became the first 311 album to not receive an RIAA certification.\n\nEvolver is an &quot;Enhanced CD&quot; containing a featurette on the making of the album cover.\n\n\n311 (pronounced &quot;three-eleven&quot;) is an American rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist/guitarist Nick Hexum, lead guitarist Jim Watson (who would later be replaced by Tim Mahoney), bassist Aaron &quot;P-Nut&quot; Wills and drummer Chad Sexton. In 1992, Doug &quot;SA&quot; Martinez joined to sing and provide turntables for 311's later albums, rounding out the current line-up. The band's name originates from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha, Nebraska, after the original guitarist for the band was arrested for streaking.\n\nTo date, 311 has released eleven studio albums, one live album, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums Music (1993) and Grassroots (1994) to moderate success. They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album, which reached No. 12 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the singles &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, the former of which topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996. The band's next three albums, Transistor (1997), Soundsystem (1999) and From Chaos (2001), did not achieve the massive success of the self-titled album, though they were still successful, with the first going platinum and the last two going gold. Their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits '93Ã¢â‚¬â€œ'03 was also certified gold. The band's most recent studio album is 2014's Stereolithic. As of 2011, 311 has sold over 8.5 million records in the US.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolver_(311_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolver_(311_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAcbmAAgE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAcbmAAgE&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7800kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bit]    \n   Duration: 00:04:10\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
