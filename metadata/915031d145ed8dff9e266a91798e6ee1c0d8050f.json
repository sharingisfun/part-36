Simon Allardice\nuses JavaScript to explore the core syntax of a programming\nlanguage, and shows how to write and execute your first\napplication and understand what s going on under the hood. The\ncourse covers creating small programs to explore conditions\nloops, variables, and expressions; working with different kinds\nof data and seeing how they affect memory; writing modular code;\nand how to debug, all using different approaches to constructing\nsoftware applications\n\nFinally, the course compares how code is written in several\ndifferent languages, the libraries and frameworks that have\ngrown around them, and the reasons to choose each one\n\nTopics include:\n\n* Writing source code\n* Understanding compiled and interpreted languages\n* Requesting input\n* Working with numbers, characters, strings, and operators\n* Writing conditional code\n* Making the code modular\n* Writing loops\n* Finding patterns in strings\n* Working with arrays and collections\n* Adopting a programming style\n* Reading and writing to various locations\n* Debugging\n* Managing memory usage\n* Learning about other languages\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nUnpack, burn or mount and enjoy\n\nGREETINGS\n\nWe salute our friends, our loyal members and our fair competitors\n\nTHE ALMIGHTY QUASAR 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:915031d145ed8dff9e266a91798e6ee1c0d8050f","amp;dn":"+Lynda+com+Foundations+of+Programming+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"915031d145ed8dff9e266a91798e6ee1c0d8050f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,80,49,209,69,237,141,255,158,38,106,145,121,142,110,225,192,216,5,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
