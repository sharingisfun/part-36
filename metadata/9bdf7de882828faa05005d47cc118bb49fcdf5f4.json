They rose to fame with their debut album Vivid in 1988. Stylistically their music is a creative fusion influenced by heavy metal, funk, guitar-based rock, free jazz, hardcore punk and hip hop. While being labeled &quot;unique&quot; by the mainstream media, they were linked to the funk metal movement of the late 1980s typified by bands such as Fishbone, Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Primus, and 24-7 Spyz. Although the band scored a number of hits, they are best remembered for their anthemic single &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1989, and &quot;Type&quot; - their highest charting single. They were also named Best New Artist at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nLiving Colour was ranked #70 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

So why, nearly forty years on, is the idea of a black rock &amp; roll band such an anomaly in pop's social order, not to mention unspeakable on AOR radio? At a time when Jesse Jackson is confronting America with the serious possibility of a black man in the White House, what's so improbable about a black rock band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fueled by racial pride yet preaching the unity gospel, equally inspired by Led Zeppelin and George Clinton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ scoring in the white mainstream?\n\nWith Vivid, the improbable is now the inevitable. Living Colour, the all-black no-bullshit flagship band of New York's Black Rock Coalition, has already wowed local rainbow crowds of Mohawks, metalheads and soul brethren with its fusion of buzz-saw punk, slam-dunk funk, avant-jazz frenzy and arena-rock waaaagh! It's all wrapped up tight with the pop-hook savvy and barbed-wire fretwork of guitarist-songwriter Vernon Reid, and if nothing else, you can easily dig Vivid on a purely visceral level, thanks in no small part to the in-your-face fidelity of Ed Stasium's production.\n\n&quot;Cult of Personality&quot; and &quot;Middle Man&quot; are right up Heavy Metal Blooze Street, Reid slicing and dicing riffs like some six-string Zorro. &quot;Glamour Boys,&quot; one of two dynamite pre-Epic demos produced by Mick Jagger and wisely included here, kicks like an ornery mule and sports a knockout chorus (&quot;I ain't no glamour boy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I'M FIERCE&quot;. And singer Corey Glover lights a Memphis R&amp;B bonfire under a brilliant reconstruction of Talking Heads' &quot;Memories Can't Wait,&quot; torching David Byrne's original nervous paranoia with a brooding soulful hurt stoked by Reid's periodic guitar tantrums. \n\nTracklist and quality it listed in the NFO.
