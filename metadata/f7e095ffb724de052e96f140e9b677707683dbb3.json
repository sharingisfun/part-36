This is more than the number of Americans with heart disease, asthma, or diabetes. In fact, at any one time, an estimated twenty million Americans are experiencing a headache.\n\nYet, the cause of headaches remains a mystery. This interesting and fact-filled book examines the mystery that surrounds headaches, as well as traditional and alternative headache treatments, the challenges of living with headaches, and the direction of future research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e095ffb724de052e96f140e9b677707683dbb3","amp;dn":"Diseases+and+Disorders+-+Headaches+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e095ffb724de052e96f140e9b677707683dbb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,224,149,255,183,36,222,5,46,150,241,64,233,182,119,112,118,131,219,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
