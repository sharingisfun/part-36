Hell is a playground.\n\nWould it be your ultimate fantasy to enter the world of a video game?\n\nA realm where you don't have to go to work or worry about your health; where you can look like a hero or a goddess; where you can fly space-ships, slay dragons, yet all of it feels completely real. A realm where there are no consequences and no responsibilities.\n\nOr would it be your worst nightmare?\n\nStuck in an endless state of war and chaos where the pain and fear feels real and from which not even death can offer an escape.\n\nPrison or playground. Heaven or hell. This is where you find out. This is white-knuckle action, sprawling adventure, merciless satire and outrageous humour like you've never experienced.\n\nThis is Bedlam.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3a1a2a33e9e3298e101cf5a526a8dad3d265e7","amp;dn":"BEDLAM.Chris+Brookmyre.mb4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3a1a2a33e9e3298e101cf5a526a8dad3d265e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,58,26,42,51,233,227,41,142,16,28,245,165,38,168,218,211,210,101,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
