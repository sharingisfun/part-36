We\\&amp;#039;ve taken it up a notch, and we\\&amp;#039;re not apologizing!\n\nWe twist the realities of unwitting people who have been set up by their friends and family members for the scare of a lifetime. Every situation is shot as if it\\&amp;#039;s a movie ? except that the starring \\&quot;victims\\&quot; are real people with real emotions and absolutely no clue that they are about to be taken on heart-pounding thrill-rides that will leave them creeped out, gasping and screaming.\n\nThe best part? The entire experience is being captured on videotape!\n\nScare Tactics is hosted by Stephen Baldwin and produced by Hallock Healey Entertainment.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395c3e9ac07166a98d5978d7b410c0b8485ac55c","amp;dn":"Scare.Tactics.S01E22.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395c3e9ac07166a98d5978d7b410c0b8485ac55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,92,62,154,192,113,102,169,141,89,120,215,180,16,192,184,72,90,197,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
