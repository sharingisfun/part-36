It was an issue-for-issue reprint of Mark Schultz's excellent &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; (available on TPB) but in color, whereas the original was in black and white.\n\nWikipedia summarizes:\n\nIn the storyline, the Earth has been ravaged by pollution and natural disasters of all sorts. To escape this, humanity built vast underground cities in which they lived for approximately 600 years. Upon emerging, the humans found that the world had been reclaimed by previously extinct lifeforms (most spectacularly, dinosaurs). In the new 'Xenozoic' era, technology is extremely limited and those with mechanical skills command a great deal of respect and influence.\n\n\nProps to the creative teams and the scanners.
