(Fraunhofer CBR 32kbps/22050 Hz Mono)\n\n\n\n[ Book 1 in The Dark is Rising sequence ]\n\n&quot;Over Sea Under Stone&quot; features the three Drew children coming to stay with Merriman Lyon. In his attic, they find an ancient treasure map that leads to a hidden grail -- if they can only figure out what the map's writing and symbols mean. But they are not the only ones who are looking for the grail -- three sinister people are in pursuit.\n\nSusan Cooper's &quot;Dark is Rising&quot; sequence has joined the Prydain Chronicles and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as timeless books that are technically for kids, but not necessarily JUST for kids. With her use of myth and folklore, rich language, and a time-spanning battle between good and evil, Cooper spins up a rare tale in her majestic prose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ff19c1bd322ae00e8993ea1265e715bf735ecc","amp;dn":"Over+Sea+Under+Stone+-+Susan+Cooper+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ff19c1bd322ae00e8993ea1265e715bf735ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,255,25,193,189,50,42,224,14,137,147,234,18,101,231,21,191,115,94,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
