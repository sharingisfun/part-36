Struggling with drug abuse and schizophrenia, he spent 3 years in Rusk State Hospital after pleading insanity on marijuana charges. His new band, Roky Erickson and the Aliens managed to stay vital during the 70's with a darker and more aggressive rock sound. After losing interest in music, he became a recluse, living in poverty and filth. The movie details the rise and fall of Roky Erickson and his brothers struggle to get Rokys life back on track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c144fb6383c80287e2b069afaa9e5295bbb848ba","amp;dn":"Roky+Ericksson+-+You%5C%27re+Gonna+Miss+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c144fb6383c80287e2b069afaa9e5295bbb848ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,68,251,99,131,200,2,135,226,176,105,175,170,158,82,149,187,184,72,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
