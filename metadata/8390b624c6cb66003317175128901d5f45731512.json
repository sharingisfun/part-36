Joachim (director Amalric) left his home, his family and his career in Paris to go to the United States and pursue new opportunities. Several years later, he comes back on a mission -- Joachim has become a devotee of &quot;New Burlesque,&quot; in which dancers combine the glamour and style of classic era exotic performers with a new and transgressive approach. Joachim has assembled a troupe of New Burlesque performers and brought them to Europe, certain there's a large and enthusiastic audience waiting for them in France. However, France isn't quite as certain, and Joachim has a hard time finding venues for his performers, while his show-biz contacts from his days as a television producer are quite wary of his latest scheme. Joachim also learns that his former girlfriend (Florence Ben Sadoun) isn't especially happy to see him, and he ends up taking their two sons with him as he criss-crosses the secondary markets of France with his dancers. Tournee (aka On Tour) was an official selection at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.
