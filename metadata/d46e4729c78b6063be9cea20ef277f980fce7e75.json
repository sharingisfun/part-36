I got a complaint about not seeding, which annoys me. I seed my torrents as much as my ISP allows (about 250kB/s)! But it's true that I have a lot to seed so it's spread thin right now. -- Of course, if certain assholes would seed ...! Instead they download 100% of 200 Brave &amp; the Bold comics, then quickly hit the stop button so they don't have to upload ...!\n\nAnyway, where the fuck did they get this cover artist? It's awful.
