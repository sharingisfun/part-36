From multi-core to GPU systems up to the distributed architectures, the high computation of programs throughout requires the use of programming tools and software libraries. Because of this, it is becoming increasingly important to know what the parallel programming techniques are. Python is commonly used as even non-experts can easily deal with its concepts.\n\nThis book will teach you parallel programming techniques using examples in Python and will help you explore the many ways in which you can write code that allows more than one process to happen at once. Starting with introducing you to the world of parallel computing, it moves on to cover the fundamentals in Python. This is followed by exploring the thread-based parallelism model using the Python threading module by synchronizing threads and using locks, mutex, semaphores queues, GIL, and the thread pool","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f6236bb04eeb0adb0c3926a492c8a89ee66c14","amp;dn":"Python+Parallel+Programming+Cookbook+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f6236bb04eeb0adb0c3926a492c8a89ee66c14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,246,35,107,176,78,235,10,219,12,57,38,164,146,200,168,158,230,108,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
