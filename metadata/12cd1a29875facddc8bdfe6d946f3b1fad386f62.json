With &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America, an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner, are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie&amp;#039;s life were all the film was concerned about, then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in America&amp;#039;s attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she accomplishes this goal admirably, holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own &quot;enlightened&quot; 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism, this is a film needed more than ever.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nLGLuX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12cd1a29875facddc8bdfe6d946f3b1fad386f62","amp;dn":"The.Notorious.Betty.Page.Eng.DVDRip-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12cd1a29875facddc8bdfe6d946f3b1fad386f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,205,26,41,135,95,172,221,200,189,254,109,148,111,59,31,173,56,111,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
