This compilation spans his career from 1991 to 2007, each disc complemented with re-mixes, live performances, and re-interpretations in addition to the original tracks.\n\nIn a country filled with cookie-cutter annoying pop-groups Seo Taiji breaks the mold... Though to Western ears, he sounds like a ripoff artist, he single-handedly introduced hip-hop then metal to Korea.  His early albums sound a lot like Cypress Hill while later albums sound like Korn...  In any case, he may well be the savior of Korean music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c216586c651a4189415d535b7ca5c630e8d331","amp;dn":"Seo+Taiji+-+%5B%26%5D+%28Special+Edition+Discography%29+%28Korean+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c216586c651a4189415d535b7ca5c630e8d331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,194,22,88,108,101,26,65,137,65,93,83,91,124,165,198,48,232,211,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
