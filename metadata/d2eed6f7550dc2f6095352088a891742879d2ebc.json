One of these, the proof that all pure mathematics deals exclusively with concepts deÃ¯Â¬ï¿½nable in terms of a very small number of fundamental logical concepts, and that all its propositions are deducible from a very small number of fundamental logical principles, is undertaken in Parts II.Ã¢â‚¬â€VII. of this Volume, and will be established by strict symbolic reasoning in Volume II. The demonstration of this thesis has, if I am not mistaken, all the certainty and precision of which mathematical demonstrations are capable. As the thesis is very recent among mathematicians, and is almost universally denied by philosophers, I have undertaken, in this volume, to defend its various parts, as occasion arose, against such adverse theories as appeared most widely held or most diÃ¯Â¬Æ’cult to disprove. I have also endeavoured to present, in language as untechnical as possible, the more important stages in the deductions by which the thesis is established.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2eed6f7550dc2f6095352088a891742879d2ebc","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Mathematics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2eed6f7550dc2f6095352088a891742879d2ebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,238,214,247,85,13,194,246,9,83,82,8,138,137,23,66,135,157,46,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
