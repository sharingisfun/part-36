RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam\n             DOX :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action\n\n\nMajor Fixes:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n- Fixes bug where players who started playing single player on or after the\n  28th of February would be unable to continue their save. All of the saved\n  data should be intact. This bug was that the game was falsely reporting\n  that there were no save games and now thats fixed.\n- Interpolated re-enabled with improved logic to avoid the post-pause\n  stutter and to generally be smoother than before.\n-\tAlt+Tab works much better in the albumn cover menu. Backgrounds no longer\n  go black when alt+tabbing. Some UI textures may still exhibit problems\n  elsewhere in the game.\n-\tMatchmaking will allow a much broader range of players to match with one\n  another, fixing some reported problems of players not finding any matches\n  or finding the same person over and over again.\n-\tSteam Cloud support has been added and is working!!!\n\n\n 1.
