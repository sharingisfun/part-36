Nisbett\n\nYEAR: 2009\n\nFORMAT: djvu\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nA bold refutation of the belief that genes determine intelligence.\n\nWho are smarter, Asians or Westerners? Are there genetic explanations for \nracial differences in test scores? What makes some nationalities excel in engineering and \nothers in music? Will math and science remain a largely male preserve. \nFrom the damning research of The Bell Curve to the more recent controversy surrounding \ngeneticist James Watson's statements, one factor has been consistently left out of \nthe equation: culture. In the tradition of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould, \nworld-class social psychologist Richard E. Nisbett takes on the idea of intelligence \nas something that is biologically determined and \nimpervious to culture--with vast implications for the role of education as \nit relates to social and economic development. \n\nIntelligence and How to Get It asserts that intellect is not primarily genetic \nbut is principally determined by societal influences. Nisbett's commanding argument, \nsuperb marshaling of evidence, and fearless discussions of the controversial carve \nout new and exciting terrain in this hotly debated field.\n\nTHIS FILE IS IN &quot;DJVU&quot; FORMAT...USE DJVU READER TO READ IT...\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\nCOMMENT IF U LIKE MY RELEASE...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3016696c31e7106435f4f2e1ae3007f89ecb1f5","amp;dn":"Intelligence+and+How+to+Get+It+-+Why+Schools+and+Cultures+Count","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3016696c31e7106435f4f2e1ae3007f89ecb1f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,1,102,150,195,30,113,6,67,95,79,46,26,227,0,127,137,236,177,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
