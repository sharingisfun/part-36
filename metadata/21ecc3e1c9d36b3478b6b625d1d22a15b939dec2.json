Some of the amusing tracks on this album are &quot;The Unfettered Boob,&quot; &quot;Taking Aim,&quot; &quot;Fit or Fat,&quot; and a boisterously entertaining number called &quot;Marriage, Movies, Madonna and Mick.&quot; Younger fans might not get the full impact of some of the jokes, since at times Midler takes shots at popular musical artists from the '80s, but there's enough other material to laugh over to make it worth the buy. Not a buy for really young fans, though. This comedy album does come with a parental warning sticker because of both language and themes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_Will_Be_Flung_Tonight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_Will_Be_Flung_Tonight&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMud Will Be Flung Tonight is an album by the American singer and comedienne Bette Midler. It is a live recording of one of Midler's stand-up comedy shows performed in 1985. Although primarily a spoken word album, Midler is accompanied onstage by her long-time musical collaborator Marc Shaiman on piano. The album captures Midler &quot;throwing mud into the faces of some of your favorites&quot;, among them Madonna (&quot;Like a virgin.....? Touched for the very first time....? For the very first time today!&quot;) Meryl Streep, Bruce Springsteen and Olivia Newton-John (&quot;Let's get physical... let me hear your body talk..... My body said &quot;Fuck you!!!&quot;) and it also includes the original version of the song &quot;Otto Titsling&quot;, three years later re-recorded in the studio and prominently featured in the movie Beaches.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ecc3e1c9d36b3478b6b625d1d22a15b939dec2","amp;dn":"Bette+Midler+-+Mud+Will+Be+Flung+Tonight%21+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ecc3e1c9d36b3478b6b625d1d22a15b939dec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,236,195,225,201,211,107,52,120,182,182,37,209,210,42,21,185,57,222,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
