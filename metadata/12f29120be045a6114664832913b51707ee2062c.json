The years-ahead-of-its-time plotline involves Russian espionage activity in London. The mastermind is Haghi (Rudolph Klein-Rogge), a supposedly respectable carnival sideshow entertainer. Heading the good guys is Agent 326 (Willy Fritsch), with the help of defecting Russian spy Sonya (Gerda Maurus). The film moves swiftly to several potential climaxes, each one more exciting than its predecessor. Haghi's ultimate demise is a superbly staged Pirandellian vignette. Anticipating Citizen Kane by a dozen years, director Lang dispenses with all transitional dissolves and fade-outs, flat-cutting territory from one scene to another. The film was co-scripted by Lang and his then-wife Thea Von Harbou.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Spione.1928.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 399 Kbps\nLength            : 7.78 GiB for 2h 30mn 28s 96ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #1          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019415/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019415/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Silent, with German Intertitles\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip of MoC Blu-Ray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12f29120be045a6114664832913b51707ee2062c","amp;dn":"Spione.1928.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12f29120be045a6114664832913b51707ee2062c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,242,145,32,190,4,90,97,20,102,72,50,145,59,81,112,126,226,6,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
