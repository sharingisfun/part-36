The band is so into them. \n\nThe rhythm section thunders. Eric is all electric lightning strikes. And just a singer in a rock and roll band is but Miss World. You can watch how Miss Olympia mounts Mount Olympus. By Zeus, this is Hera's era now. \n\nCourtney rules her court with fine fiddle, in great voice and super humor, with 'come on, abandon!' Love is all around, totally out of and always in complete control. Out of the fire and into the... fire away! \n\nThis for now is the best band in Seattle and all the world. This is hers. \n\nYou shoulda been there. Hole are the loud bang theory of fast, nasty &amp; loose, punk/pop intelligence. The fast and funny, last blast that lasts. Lollapalooza 1995-07-25 was my date with destiny with the goddess. Seeing and hearing is believing there is a Hole in the center of my universe. That &quot;if you live through this with me, I swear that I would die for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;I want to be the girl with the most cake.&quot;\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nArt samples...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/Reading1994Flyer.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/Reading1994Flyer.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/Tray.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/Tray.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/BookletContents.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/BookletContents.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/CD.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/CD.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/BackCover.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/BackCover.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f83f9612e220ca833b06bba12d1f9d199b0f367","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Reading+Festival+%2B+Hollywood+Palladium+1994+-+Pre-FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f83f9612e220ca833b06bba12d1f9d199b0f367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,131,249,97,46,34,12,168,51,176,107,186,18,209,249,209,153,176,243,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
