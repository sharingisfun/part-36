All are digitally re-mastered, with rare and previously unreleased bonus material supplementing each release.\n\n\nWilly And The Poor Boys (40th Anniversary Edition)\n\nWritten by El Bicho\n\n\nIn honor of the 40th anniversary of their debut album, Fantasy Records is releasing the six studio albums of the band as a quartet. No word yet of their final album, Mardi Gras, which found lead guitarist John Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford as a trio after rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty quit.\n\nWilly and the Poor Boys was the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fourth album and the third to be released in 1969, capping an amazing creative output. The album opens with the Stax Records-sounding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown on the Corner.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ John sings and tells the story of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfour kids on the corner trying to bring you upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ whom the album is named after. The song is a joyous number, capturing the spirit of playing music for its own sake, offsetting the despair of others who find themselves stuck in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLodiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ again, as sung about on previously on Green River.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt Came Out of The SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ evokes the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“50s with JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jangly, Chuck Berry-influenced guitar, a driving rhythm section, and lyrics bringing to mind sci-fi movies about aliens. Doug pounds the cymbals during the final chorus. Kids might miss out on the name-dropping as Vice President Spiro Agnew, California Governor Ronald Reagan, and CBS Television newsmen Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid all get referenced.\n\nCreedence offers a tip oÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the hat to musician Leadbelly on Willy. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCotton FieldsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is played as a laidback, country rock song, sounding like The Eagles before the Eagles existed. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Midnight SpecialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a traditional song Leadbelly was known for playing. While the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hits were popular on the radio in 1983, this deep cut appeared in the opening of Twilight Zone: The Movie and revealed a different side of the band to an audience who barely knew them. Starting as a blues number, JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s distant vocal and the slow, extended playing of the guitar notes are compelling. Then, the rest of the band joins in and it becomes signature Creedence.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoorboy ShuffleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds like a jugband instrumental, possibly with the washboard and the gut bass referenced in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown on the Corner.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ If you go by the album photos, JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harmonica leads the way. It crossfades with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFeelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Blue,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a rhythm &amp; blues number so authentic itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to assume itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a cover, but John is credited as the writer. It oozes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmoothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as they shuffle along and create one of the few CCR tunes to make out to.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFortunate SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the classic antiwar song that drew attention to the inequity between the majority of poor and working class folk who went to Vietnam and those who avoided the draft because they were sons of senators and millionaires. Yet, it transcends that time and still resonates today because it speaks to the inequities in society. President George W. Bush, as one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œborn silver spoon in handÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and who sent many ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdown to war,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a perfect embodiment of the title character. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Look NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is definitely Sun Records rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll with John giving us a little Elvis in his vocal. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSide of the RoadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds like CreedenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to Booker T. &amp; the M.G.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreen Onions.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ TomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rhythm guitar fills in for BookerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organ and John recreates Steve CropperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar sound as the rest of band keeps a sure and steady beat.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEffigyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the longest song and closes the album proper. It sounds more like the music coming out of the San Francisco scene at the time. The tone of JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar is more ragged-sounding, like Neil Young, and DougÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drums are more prominent. The lyrics tell a very interesting tale of revolution. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s my favorite discovery.\n\nThis edition offers three bonus tracks. The first two tracks are more previously unreleased tracks record live in Europe 1971 during the final tour of the trio. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFortunate SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Manchester, England sounds decent, but the vocal drowns out the guitars. The drums can be heard between. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt Came Out of The SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Berlin, Germany has a similar sound level with the guitar slightly raised in the mix, but not by much.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown on the CornerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is taken from a jam session with Booker T. &amp; the M.G.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recorded for a TV special in 1970. Surprisingly, the historic moment wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t better captured because it sounds like a consumer tape recorder captured the song in mono. The liner notes state it is the best source available. BookerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organ and CropperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar are the most obvious elements added to the arrangement.\n\nWilly and the Poor Boys is another worthy addition to the band's catalog and a continuing testament to their talents. The wide appeal of Creedence Clearwater Revival is evident by how well the album performed as it crossed over and appeared on both the Pop Album and Black Album charts. It also had two singles make the Pop charts, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown On The CornerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ doing the best by reaching #3, and one hit the Country charts.\n\n\n\n01 Down on the Corner\n02 It Came out of the Sky\n03 Cotton Fields\n04 Poorboy Shuffle\n05 Feelin' Blue\n06 Fortunate Son\n07 Don't Look Now\n08 The Midnight Special\n09 Side O' the Road\n10 Effigy\n11 Fortunate Son (Live in Manchester, 9/1/71) [bonus track]\n12 It Came Out of the Sky (Live in Berlin, 9/16/71) [bonus track]\n13 Down on the Corner (1970 jam With Booker T. &amp; the MGs at Fantasy) [bonus track]\n\n\n\n\n    * John Fogerty - lead vocals, lead guitar, harmonica, keyboards, saxophone\n    * Tom Fogerty - rhythm guitar, backing vocals, piano\n    * Stu Cook - bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards\n    * Doug Clifford - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:092c6369523307f496dddcdb5e99718adf30f165","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival-Willy+And+The+Poor+Boys%281969%29%282008+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"092c6369523307f496dddcdb5e99718adf30f165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,44,99,105,82,51,7,244,150,221,220,219,94,153,113,138,223,48,241,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
