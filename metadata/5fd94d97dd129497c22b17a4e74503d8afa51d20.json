The views on hydroformylation which still prevail have become obsolete in several respects. This text collects these advances together in one place. It contains a series of chapters discussing several rhodium systems arranged according to ligand type, including asymmetric ligands, a chapter on applications in organic chemistry, a chapter on modern processes and separations, and a chapter on catalyst preparation and laboratory techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd94d97dd129497c22b17a4e74503d8afa51d20","amp;dn":"Rhodium+Catalyzed+Hydroformylation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd94d97dd129497c22b17a4e74503d8afa51d20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,217,77,151,221,18,148,151,194,43,23,164,231,69,3,216,175,165,29,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
