Consolidating their \nhighly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, and the interest \ngenerated by their first album, Santana (released in May 1969), the band took some time to issue \na follow-up. Released in September, 1970, the album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other \ninfluences made it a classic that defined Santana's early sound, and showed a musical maturation \nfrom their first album.\n\nThe title of the album comes from a line from Herman Hesse's book Demian, which is quoted on the \nalbum's back cover: &quot;We stood before it and began to freeze inside from the exertion. We questioned \nthe painting, berated it, made love to it, prayed to it: We called it mother, called it whore and \nslut, called it our beloved, called it Abraxas..The word &quot;Abraxas&quot; has use within Gnostic cosmology.\n\n\n\n   1.
