Booster is initially depicted as a glory-seeking showboat from the future, using knowledge of historical events and futuristic technology to stage high-publicity heroics. The character develops over the course of his publication history and through personal tragedies to become a hero weighed down by the reputation he has created for himself. Booster also became regular member of the Justice League remaining with the team member until the group was disbanded in 1996 to make way for a new team known as the JLA.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4069245215adf25fe353dea32f1fac0b1775390c","amp;dn":"Booster+Gold+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4069245215adf25fe353dea32f1fac0b1775390c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,105,36,82,21,173,242,95,227,83,222,163,47,31,172,11,23,117,57,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
