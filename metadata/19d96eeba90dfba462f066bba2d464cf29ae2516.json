COMBINING HEAVY GUITARS WITH SMOOTH CATCHY VOCALS, STARZ CREATED ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY COPIED SOUNDS OF ALL TIME. ONE LISTEN TO THIS THE FIRST STARZ ALBUM WILL SHOW YOU WHY THEY WERE A MAINSTAY ON THE 70'S SCENE. THE MUSIC THAT HAS INSPIRED ALL OF TODAY'S METAL SUPERSTARS, SOUNDS JUST AS FRESH AND EXCITING TODAY AS IT DID THEN. I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO BRING YOU THE ENTIRE STARZ CATALOG ON CD AND CASSETTE. I THINK YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT STARZ IS ONE OF THE BEST ALL TIME GREATEST METAL BANDS !!!  -BRIAN SLAGLE- \n\n1.  DETROIT GIRLS (SWEVAL / RANNO / SMITH) 4:00\n2.
