An alphabetical Table of\nContents for the articles can be found beginning on p. v of\nthis introductory section.\nAs a reader of the Encyclopedia, you can use this alphabetical\nTable of Contents by itself to locate a topic.

For example, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTemperature,\nEffects on Development and GrowthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the title assigned to\nthis article, rather than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEffects of Temperature on Development\nand Growth,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because the specific term Temperature is\nthe key word.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:126b363f39ed3a0ed4b4d328a8e697bbd2bc6ddc","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Insects+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"126b363f39ed3a0ed4b4d328a8e697bbd2bc6ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,107,54,63,57,237,58,14,212,180,211,40,168,230,151,187,210,188,109,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
