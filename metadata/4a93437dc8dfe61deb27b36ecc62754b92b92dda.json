Parliament/Funkadelic's influence is impossible to miss on this very derivative LP, which can hardly be called innovative and certainly won't win any awards for its originality. Some reviewers slammed Mutiny leader Jerome Brailey for going out of his way to emulate Parliament/Funkadelic; the thing is, he does it so darn well that you'll be tapping your foot while you're commenting on the album's lack of originality. When Mutiny tears into goofy Clinton-esque numbers like &quot;Lump,&quot; &quot;Romeo (Hope You're Feeling Better),&quot; and &quot;Funk 'N' Bop,&quot; the P-Funk grooves aren't mildly infectious -- they're extremely infectious. You might end up complaining about how Mutiny goes to such trouble to sound like Parliament/Funkadelic most of the time -- and your complaints wouldn't be unwarranted -- but you'll want to get up and dance while you're complaining.\n\n\n1 &quot;Go Away from Here&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Lenny Holmes, Raymond Carter, Robert Mittleman)\n2 &quot;What More Can I Say&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Skitch Lovett)\n3 &quot;Lump&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Raymond Carter) (released as a single-Columbia 111153 and 12&quot; single-Columbia AS 696)\n4 &quot;Funk 'N' Bop&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Lenny Holmes) (released as 7&quot; single- Columbia 11049 and 12&quot; single-Columbia AS 655)\n5 &quot;Burning Up&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Lenny Holmes, Raymond Carter)\n6 &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the &quot;P&quot;&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Lenny Holmes, Raymond Carter)\n7 &quot;Everytime You Come Around&quot; (Jerome Brailey, Lenny Holmes, Raymond Carter)\n8 &quot;Romeo (Hope You're Feeling Better)&quot; (Jerome Brailey)\n\n\n    Jerome Brailey - Drums, percussion, Syndrums, vocals\n    Lenny Holmes - Lead guitar, vocals\n    Skitch Lovett - Guitars, vocals\n    Raymond Carter - Bass guitars, vocals, smiles\n    Nat Lee - Keyboards, semi-vocals\n    Daryl Dixon, Marvin Daniels, Melvin El - Horns\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/mutiny-on-the-mamaship-mw0001138996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/mutiny-on-the-mamaship-mw0001138996&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a93437dc8dfe61deb27b36ecc62754b92b92dda","amp;dn":"Mutiny+-+Mutiny+On+The+Mamaship+%281979%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Funkadelic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a93437dc8dfe61deb27b36ecc62754b92b92dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,147,67,125,200,223,230,29,235,39,179,110,204,98,117,75,146,185,45,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
