Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C. Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying C programming language. \n\nThis unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study. \n\nThis edition has been fully updated to incorporate new Objective-C features and technologies introduced with Xcode 5, iOS 7, and Mac OS X Mavericks.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The best book on any programming language that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever read.
