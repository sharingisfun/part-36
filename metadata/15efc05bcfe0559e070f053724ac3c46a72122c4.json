Excellent\n\n\nDescription:\n\nDarwin\\'s Dilemma: The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record. This feature-length documentary examines the Cambrian explosion of life, one of the most remarkable events in the history of our planet. During the Cambrian period complex animals first appeared on earth fully formed in a geological instant - without evidence of any evolutionary ancestors. Audience response to advance screenings of this third DVD in the intelligent design trilogy has been outstanding.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \\&quot;Darwin\\'s Dilemma\\&quot; completes the trilogy of powerful documentaries establishing the\n    superiority of intelligent design over Darwinism. It is the capstoneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦and it pulls\n    together arguments from the other films, adds new ones, and climaxes with a\n    resounding victory for design. Any fair-minded referee would call, \\&quot;game-over.\\&quot;\n    (D. C. - Los Angeles)\n\nCharles Darwin viewed this event as an inexplicable mystery. He had envisioned the evolution of life through a multitude of small, undirected steps. Yet, the fossil record reveals no such pattern of gradual development. Instead, early in the Cambrian period compound eyes, articulated limbs, sophisticated sensory organs and skeletons burst into existence seemingly out of nowhere.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \\&quot;...this film is outstanding. I\\'m not a scientist, but the evidence and arguments were\n    presented so clearly and convincingly, there\\'s no way that Darwinian evolution can\n    stand up to them. Where is the missing evidence Darwin\\'s theory requires? It\\'s just\n    not there.\\&quot;\n    (J. C. - North Carolina)\n\nFilmed in the United Kingdom, China, South America and the Canadian Rockies, Darwin\\'s Dilemma explores some of the most important fossil discoveries ever made and with them, a mystery deeper than Darwin ever imagined. For, the Cambrian explosion was actually an explosion of biological information - assembly instructions in DNA and embryonic blueprints that directed the development of the first complex animals. Information that could only be the product of foresight, purpose and intelligent design.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \\&quot;...a magnificent program. Just superb. The animation and logic are incredible. We\\'ll\n    definitely be purchasing copies and showing them to students and faculty this fall, as\n    well as at local churches and libraries.\\&quot;\n    (A. B. - Santa Barbara, CA)\n\nThe Privileged Planet is an hour-long documentary that explores the scientific evidence for intelligent design and purpose in the universe. In the process, Earth is revealed as far more than the product of time, chance, and random natural processes.\n\n\nUnlocking the Mystery of Life is the story of top-notch, contemporary scientists who are advancing a powerful idea -- \\&quot;the theory of intelligent design.\\&quot; Using state-of-the-art computer animation, this film transports you into the interior of the living cell to explore systems and machines that bear the unmistakable hallmarks of design. Discover the intricacy of a microscopic bacterial rotary motor, which spins at 100,000 rpm.\n\n\n\n\n\nIT IS HERE POtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 99A - Creating An Event In Heaven - Face To Face With Jesus &amp; The Holy Spirit\n\n Solved - Jesus Lives - coming 7-4-11.  Your Independence Day.\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                               End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                                Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                      Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                    Current Bible Prophecy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                  Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                              Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Chuck Missler - USA &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&lt;/a&gt;                                        Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
