Transcendence has a similar sound to Symphony X on some songs but that is not unusual considering a lot of progressive power metal outfits do also. The Meridian Project is based more on the power metal side but has many progressive metal elements like odd-time signatures, and complex song structures. The lyrical aspect is Christian because of TranscendenceÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02223bf6880aebcfbd8c3efff82bebda70bc4911","amp;dn":"Transcendence+2002+The+Meridian+Project+excellent+traditional+me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02223bf6880aebcfbd8c3efff82bebda70bc4911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,34,59,246,136,10,235,207,189,140,62,255,248,43,235,218,112,188,73,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
