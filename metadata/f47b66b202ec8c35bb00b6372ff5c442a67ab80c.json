At it's heart, like the first book, it's a mystery..but one with a colorful (to say the least) cast of characters. There is a focus on cybernetics, landing the book squarely in the cyberpunk sci-fi genre, but the electronic gizmos are not the focus of the story. The levels of sex and drug use, and to a slightly lesser extent the violence, in these books is astounding but I don't feel it took anything away from the story.\n\nThe Exile Kiss (1991)\n(The third book in the Marid Audran series)\n\nIngram The right hand man to one of the most feared men in the Arab world, Marid Audran is just beginning to enjoy the wealth and privilege of his position when he and his boss, the powerful Friedlander Bey, are accused of murder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f47b66b202ec8c35bb00b6372ff5c442a67ab80c","amp;dn":"George+Alec+Effinger+-+Mar%26icirc%3Bd+Audran+%5B1-3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f47b66b202ec8c35bb00b6372ff5c442a67ab80c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,123,102,178,2,236,140,53,187,0,182,55,47,245,196,66,166,122,184,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
