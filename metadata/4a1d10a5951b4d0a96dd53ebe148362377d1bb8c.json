It featured the band's biggest hits, &quot;Liar&quot; and &quot;Disconnect,&quot; which gained rotation on MTV and gained popularity after being featured on Beavis and Butthead. The song &quot;Civilized&quot; was also used as the closing theme for Dennis Miller Live from 1994-2002 on HBO.\n\n\nRollins Band was an American rock band led by singer and songwriter Henry Rollins.\n\nThey are best known for the songs &quot;Low Self Opinion&quot; and &quot;Liar&quot;, which both earned heavy airplay on MTV in the mid-late 1990s. Critic Steve Huey describes their music as &quot;uncompromising, intense, cathartic fusions of hard rock, funk, post-punk noise, and jazz experimentalism, with Rollins shouting angry, biting self-examinations and accusations over the grind.&quot;\n\nIn 2000, Rollins Band was included on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, ranking at No. 47.\n\nThe band have been categorized under the alternative metal, hard rock and post-hardcore genres. They were part of the early 90s LA alternative metal scene, alongside bands such as Tool, Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine and Green JellÃƒÂ¿. Their influences include 70s metal and rock bands, such as Black Sabbath, The Velvet Underground, Pink Fairies and Thin Lizzy. Rollins' shout-singing style proved influential to later nu metal and alternative metal artists such as Coal Chamber, Korn, Chevelle, Godsmack and System of a Down. Rollins Band have been covered by Pearl Jam.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HACbfaAGE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HACbfaAGE&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8242kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:04:12\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
