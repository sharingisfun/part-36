The band consisted of Eric Malmberg (organ, synthesizer), and Ulf MÃƒÂ¶ller (drums). The band&amp;#039;s sound was defined by Malmberg&amp;#039;s distinctive organ playing.\n\nThe duo formed in 1999, and released four albums between 2001 and 2004. They disbanded for unknown reasons after their fourth album. Malmberg continues to work as a solo artist, releasing his first album in 2005.\n\nOrgelfÃƒÂ¤rger (2001)\nMelodier och fÃƒÂ¥glar (2002)\nAllt hÃƒÂ¤nger samman (2003)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sagorochswing.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sagorochswing.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagor_&amp;_Swing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagor_&amp;_Swing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9143b43f13537d3e249574e409691b20c9886e58","amp;dn":"Sagor+och+Swing+-+Three+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9143b43f13537d3e249574e409691b20c9886e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,67,180,63,19,83,125,62,36,149,116,228,9,105,27,32,201,136,110,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
