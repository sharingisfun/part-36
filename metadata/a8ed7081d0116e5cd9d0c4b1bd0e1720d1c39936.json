But while Genesis records the identity of Abel's killer, the world's first death remains, in essence, a mystery. What compelled Cain to kill his only brother? How did he do it? Did Cain realize that he was capable of ending Abel's life? And what of the strange paradoxes in the scripture: Cain's fear of strangers in an unpopulated world and the sudden appearance of a future wife? In this fascinating investigation, modern scholars work like detectives, searching for clues in the 17 verses that describe humanity's first tragic crime and explore its ultimate message of resiliency and hope. \n\nFile Size ------- 330mb\nLength ---------- 45:10\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ed7081d0116e5cd9d0c4b1bd0e1720d1c39936","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Mysteries+of+the+Bible+-+Cain+and+Abel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ed7081d0116e5cd9d0c4b1bd0e1720d1c39936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,237,112,129,208,17,110,92,217,208,196,177,189,14,23,32,209,195,153,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
