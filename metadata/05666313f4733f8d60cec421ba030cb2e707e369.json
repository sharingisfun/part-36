According to theorists, the missing six are curled up in bizarre structures known as Calabi-Yau manifolds. In The Shape of Inner Space, Shing-Tung Yau, the man who mathematically proved that these manifolds exist, argues that not only is geometry fundamental to string theory, it is also fundamental to the very nature of our universe.\n\nTime and again, where Yau has gone, physics has followed. Now for the first time, readers will follow YauÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s penetrating thinking on where weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been, and where mathematics will take us next. A fascinating exploration of a world we are only just beginning to grasp, The Shape of Inner Space will change the way we consider the universe on both its grandest and smallest scales.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 400 pages\n# Publisher: Basic Books (September 7, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0465020232\n# ISBN-13: 978-0465020232","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05666313f4733f8d60cec421ba030cb2e707e369","amp;dn":"The+Shape+of+Inner+Space+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05666313f4733f8d60cec421ba030cb2e707e369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,102,99,19,244,115,63,141,96,206,196,33,186,3,12,178,231,7,227,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
