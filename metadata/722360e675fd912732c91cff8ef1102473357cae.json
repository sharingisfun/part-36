One day, Norman's estranged eccentric uncle tells him of an important annual ritual he must take up to protect the town from a curse cast by a witch it condemned centuries ago. Eventually, Norman decides to cooperate, but things don't go according to plan. Now, a magic storm of the witch threatens Blithe Hollow as the accursed dead rise. Together with unexpected new companions, Norman struggles to save his town, only to discover the horrific truth of the curse. With that insight, Norman must resolve the crisis for good as only he can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722360e675fd912732c91cff8ef1102473357cae","amp;dn":"ParaNorman+DVDRip+-+Norsk+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722360e675fd912732c91cff8ef1102473357cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,35,96,230,117,253,145,39,50,201,28,255,142,241,16,36,115,53,124,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
