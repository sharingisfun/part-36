Sara Gruen spares no detail in chronicling the squalid, filthy, brutish circumstances in which he finds himself. The animals are mangy, underfed or fed rotten food, and abused. Jacob, once it becomes known that he has veterinary skills, is put in charge of the &quot;menagerie&quot; and all its ills. Uncle Al, the circus impresario, is a self-serving, venal creep who slaps people around because he can. August, the animal trainer, is a certified paranoid schizophrenic whose occasional flights into madness and brutality often have Jacob as their object. Jacob is the only person in the book who has a handle on a moral compass and as his reward he spends most of the novel beaten, broken, concussed, bleeding, swollen and hungover. He is the self-appointed Protector of the Downtrodden, and... he falls in love with Marlena, crazy August's wife. Not his best idea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fba1a1e5ecc45779e4a2f77179bb81c87cbed269","amp;dn":"Water+for+Elephants+audiobook+by+Sara+Gruen+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fba1a1e5ecc45779e4a2f77179bb81c87cbed269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,161,161,229,236,196,87,121,228,162,247,113,121,187,129,200,124,190,210,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
