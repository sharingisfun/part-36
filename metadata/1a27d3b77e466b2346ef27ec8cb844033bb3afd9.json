Unwilling to let the relief crew claims all the glory, he disobeys orders to pack up and goes out on an unauthorized expedition to collect further samples. But a routine excavation turns to disaster when the porous ground collapses and he falls into a deep crevice and near certain death. His devastated colleagues attempt to recover his body. However, when another vanishes, they start to suspect that the life-form they have discovered is not without danger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a27d3b77e466b2346ef27ec8cb844033bb3afd9","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+On+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a27d3b77e466b2346ef27ec8cb844033bb3afd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,39,211,183,126,70,107,35,70,239,39,236,140,184,68,3,59,179,175,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
