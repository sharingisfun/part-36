This act of faith changed her life by placing her in the genealogy of Christ.\r\n\r\nRahab is the youngest daughter of a Canaanite farmer, taken to Jericho for the pagan New Year so her father can find her a wealthy spouse. Sala, the Israelite boy who had once saved her from being kidnapped, is also in Jericho. When the two young people meet again they admit their love for one another, but their different religions make marriage impossible.\r\n\r\nTheir love story plays out against the background of Jerichoâ€™s pagan rites. It is only when the One True God of Israel comes into Rahabâ€™s lifeâ€”and she realizes what He is calling her to doâ€”that she and Sala can come together.\r\n\r\nWitness Rahab as a young woman determined to find her destiny as she follows her heart toward true love . . . and the One True God.\r\n\r\n&quot;Wolf (A Reluctant Queen) holds our interest by skillfully conjuring up a fascinating version of Rahabâ€™s story, successfully persuading us that the story is far more complex than merely a â€œscarlet cord.â€ â€”*Publishers Weekly *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a53dff57faf9b2c6dec64d6d4c25260879b3e2","amp;dn":"This+Scarlet+Cord+-+The+Love+Story+of+Rahab+-+Joan+Wolf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a53dff57faf9b2c6dec64d6d4c25260879b3e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,165,61,255,87,250,249,178,198,222,198,77,109,76,37,38,8,121,179,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
