It prints plainly ludicrous stories, such as a double-decker London bus being found frozen in the Antarctic ice, or a World War II bomber found on the moon. Defenders of the paper pointed out that it was not intended to be taken seriously. Its controversial content also includes a high quotient of softcore female nudity and extensive advertising for sexual services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday Sport â€“ 7 February 2016\r\nEnglish | PDF | 64 pages | 57,82 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:554181b4511505363b80e834932b683be27da754","amp;dn":"Sunday+Sport+%26ndash%3B+7+February+2016%5BThePirateBay%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"554181b4511505363b80e834932b683be27da754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,65,129,180,81,21,5,54,59,128,232,52,147,43,104,59,226,125,167,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
