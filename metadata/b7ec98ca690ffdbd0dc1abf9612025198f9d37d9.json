A decade later, he steps off the train and into the copper mining capital of the world in its jittery 1919 heyday. While the riches of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Richest Hill on EarthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may elude him, once again a colorful cast of local characters seek him out. Before long, Morrie is caught up in the clash between the ironfisted Anaconda Mining Company, radical Ã¢â‚¬Å“outside agitators,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the beleaguered miners. As tensions build aboveground and below, Morrie finds a unique way to give a voice to those who truly need one, and Ivan Doig proves yet again why heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reigning king of Western fiction.
