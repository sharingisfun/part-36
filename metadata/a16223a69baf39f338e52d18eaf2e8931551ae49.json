Hoberman\nHow the digital turn and 9/11 have changed motion picture history.\n\nIn this sly and thought-provoking volume, J. Hoberman turns an erudite eye to the study of twenty-first-century cinema and finds that, only a dozen years into the new millennium, the world of movies has already experienced a revolutionary transformation.\n\nThe advent of new digital technology has displaced the medium of photographic filmÃ¢â‚¬â€and, perhaps, the reality on which it once depended. With locations, sets and cameras now optional, the history of motion pictures has become the history of animation.\n\nThis sea change in filmmaking spanned the 2000 American presidential election and the trauma of 9/11, events that reshaped world politics and left an indelible imprint on the emerging aesthetic of the new centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cinema. A rupture opened up in the evolution of film, presaging, as Susan Sontag forlornly predicted a few years earlier, the death of cinephilia, or at least cinephilia as we know it.\n\nWitty and allusive, in the style of classic film theorist/critics such as AndrÃƒÂ© Bazin and Siegfried Kracauer, Film After Film expands on a much-discussed era-defining Artforum article by Hoberman before moving on to a chronicle of the Bush years in cinema (featuring reviews from HobermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final decade at the Village Voice). The book concludes with considerations of the twenty-one central movies of the twenty-first century, which include works by Lars von Trier and Jia Zhangke as well as the hi-tech spectacles WALL-E and Avatar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16223a69baf39f338e52d18eaf2e8931551ae49","amp;dn":"+9781844677511+film+after+film+Film+After+Film%3A+%28Or%2C+What+Became","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16223a69baf39f338e52d18eaf2e8931551ae49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,98,35,166,155,175,57,243,56,229,45,24,234,242,232,147,21,81,174,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
