Because the musicians in the band lived thousands of miles apart, Lucassen composed the group's debut album, Embrace the Storm, over the Internet. It was released on October 24, 2005 through InsideOut Music.\n\nWith the exception of vocalist Marcela Bovio, who had appeared on Ayreon's album The Human Equation, Lucassen selected little-known musicians to form this band.\n\nIn August 2008, it was announced that Stream of Passion has signed to Napalm Records. Their second studio album &quot;The Flame Within&quot; will be released through Napalm Records on May 27, 2009.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fddd6e6a8c6bdbe76c3d56fc5592052c484d4ca6","amp;dn":"Stream+of+Passion-The+Flame+Within-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fddd6e6a8c6bdbe76c3d56fc5592052c484d4ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,221,110,106,140,107,219,231,108,61,86,252,85,146,5,44,72,77,76,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
