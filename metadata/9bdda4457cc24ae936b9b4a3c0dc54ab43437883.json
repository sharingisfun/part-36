McPherson - War on the Waters: The Union and Confederate Navies, 1861-1865\n\n96 kbps, Unabridged, Read by Joe Barrett\n\nOverview\n\nAlthough previously undervalued for their strategic impact because the represented only a small percentage of total forces, the Union and Confederate navies were crucial to the outcome of the Civil War. In War on the Waters, James M. McPherson has crafted an enlightening, at times harrowing, and ultimately thrilling account of the war's naval campaigns and their military leaders.\nMcPherson recounts how the Union navy's blockade of the Confederate coast, leaky as a sieve in the war's early months, became increasingly effective as it choked off vital imports and exports. Meanwhile, the Confederate navy, dwarfed by its giant adversary, demonstrated daring and military innovation. Commerce raiders sank Union ships and drove the American merchant marine from the high seas. Southern ironclads sent several Union warships to the bottom, naval mines sank many more, and the Confederates deployed the world's first submarine to sink an enemy vessel. But in the end, it was the Union navy that won some of the war's most important strategic victories--as an essential partner to the army on the ground at Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Mobile Bay, and Fort Fisher, and all by itself at Port Royal, Fort Henry, New Orleans, and Memphis. \n\nThe Washington Post\nThe aim of this compact book is to prove to modern students of the war that naval superiority throughout the conflictÃ¢â‚¬â€on the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the Southern river systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€was an indispensable ingredient of Union military victory. Like his Pulitzer Prize-winning Battle Cry of Freedom, War on the Waters displays the technique that has become something of a trademark for the Princeton historian. He uses impeccable scholarship in the service of narratives that have appeal for the general readerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦McPherson has spiced his book with lots of true but largely unexploited facts and vignettes.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nMcPherson, professor emeritus of Princeton and dean of Civil War historians, enhances our knowledge with this history of the conflictÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naval aspects. As definitive as it is economical, the work establishes beyond question the decisive contributions of maritime power to Union victory. The Confederate Navy, though materially outnumbered tenfold, was technologically advanced in such fields as mines and ironclads. Its commerce raiders devastated Union merchant shipping. Nevertheless, on the sea, along the coasts, and on the inland river systems, the NorthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warships and landing parties independently achieved politically and strategically important victories: Port Royal, S.C., and Fort Henry, Tenn., Memphis and New Orleans. The fleet synergized with the army in combined operations from North Carolina to the Mississippi River and Texas. The Union Navy established and sustained a blockade without which Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Confederacy might well have prevailed,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These achievements were above all a product of pragmatism. From Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, through admirals like David Farragut and D.D. Porter, to the seamen and rivermen who joined for the duration, the Union Navy designed ships and developed doctrines to fit circumstances. Not everything worked. But as McPherson indisputably shows, the Civil WarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outcome was in good part shaped by Northern naval power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bdda4457cc24ae936b9b4a3c0dc54ab43437883","amp;dn":"James+M.+McPherson+-+War+on+the+Waters+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bdda4457cc24ae936b9b4a3c0dc54ab43437883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,221,164,69,124,194,74,233,54,185,180,163,192,220,84,171,67,67,120,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
