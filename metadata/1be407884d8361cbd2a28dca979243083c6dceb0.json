The high-priority case ends up falling into the lap of Detective Jo, a disgraced cop who he has just been put through the ringer by an internal affairs investigation. With the help of his partner Oh and a dedicated task force, Jo quickly learns that all three victims were former boyfriends of a comely but quiet museum curator named Chae Su-yeon.\n\nWith his attention focused on Su-yeon, Jo spends most of his time with her, uncovering clues from her troubled past as a means to track down the killer. Meanwhile, the body count continues to mount, and Jo soon finds himself in the killer's crosshairs. But who is behind these heinous crimes? Is it Kim Ki-yeon, an artist who is obsessed with Su-yeon? Or is it Su-yeon's best friend, a medical resident at a local hospital? Or could it be Su-yeon's estranged father, whom she has not seen in five years? Or could it be Su-yeon herself?\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.graffitiforum.se/generator/screencaps/70596_1.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.graffitiforum.se/generator/screencaps/59877_2.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.graffitiforum.se/generator/screencaps/81371_3.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.graffitiforum.se/generator/screencaps/96733_4.jpg&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;\nTHE BEST FILM OF 1999\nI don't want to give away ANY of the plot, because the less you know the better. And all you need to know is that this is the BEST serial thriller to come along since The Silence of the Lambs...it's better than Seven, it's better than Copycat, and it's even better than The Crimson Rivers. In fact, I would rate this top notch film on the same level as Dario Argento's Deep Red and Tenebre...and for those of you fortunate enough to have seen those classic films..yes, it really is THAT good! Yet whereas acting and even the screenplay are secondary to classic Italian thrillers, this gem boasts an exquisitely constructed screenplay (the ending will surely take you by surprise!) and two outstanding lead performances by the commandingly handsome Suk-kyu Han and the breathtakingly beautiful Eun-ha Shim.\n\nSadly, Tell Me Something has yet to get a US release (outside of all too rare arthouse screenings from time to time), and after two years it remains unreleased on VHS or DVD. So I would HIGHLY recommend that you all purchase the code-free NTSC Hong Kong DVD. The A/V transfer is stunning, and the English subtitles get a surprisingly accurate translation.\n\nI have no idea why none of the Hollywood studios have yet given this film a theatrical release, but like the equally brilliant Japanese horror film RING, I'm guessing it's because they are first planning an American remake...so before that dark day comes, experience for yourself the film that I consider the Best Movie of 1999 (besting even The Matrix), and one of the Top 5 Horror/Thrillers of the decade!\n\nMy Grade: A+ 10/10\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&lt;/i&gt;\nIndeed one of my favourite korean movies of all time, or globally in the thriller/mystery genre that is! Man i can still think about the plot, the twists, and what happened - and it was months since i saw it. Yes, it's complicated and for some confusing, it was like that for me too. But when i rewatched it piece after piece got togheter - i joined long discussions at IMDB and  realized what a vast and genious movie this is. You better watch it :)\n&lt;b&gt;Note: Contains alot of blood and gore&lt;/b&gt;\n\n************************************************************\n\n\nAndra torrents/filmer jag lagt upp:\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3295025&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Dead Friend [Korea 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepiratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3298369&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Cutie Honey [Japan 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3293234&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;The Blue Light [Japan 2003]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3304088&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt; Conduct Zero [Korea 2002]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3294535&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt; Barking Dogs Never Bite [Korea 2000]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3307076&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Swing Girls [Japan 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3309553&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Kids Return [Takeshi Kitano 1996]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3310096&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;A  Scene at the Sea [Takeshi Kitano 1991]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3310493&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;JDorama - [1998] Great Teacher Onizuka [JTV]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3293442&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;JDorama - [2003] Waterboys + The Movie&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3320213&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Nobody Knows [Japan 2004]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3321400&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Attack the Gas Station [Korea 1999]&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://tracker.piratbyran.org/torrents-details.php?id=3322117&amp;hit=1&quot;&gt;Sex is Zero [Korea 2002]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n************************************************************\n\nAsiantorrents\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be407884d8361cbd2a28dca979243083c6dceb0","amp;dn":"Tell+Me+Something+%5BKorea+1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be407884d8361cbd2a28dca979243083c6dceb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,228,7,136,77,131,97,203,210,162,141,202,151,146,67,8,60,109,206,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
