Using funky but unpredictable rhythm sections and leaving space for plenty of solos, Davis created a unique brand of fusion that has yet to be satisfactorily duplicated. Among his more notable sidemen during this era are altoist Kenny Garrett, Foley on lead bass (which he used as a lower-toned guitar), one or two keyboardists chosen from Joey DeFrancesco, Adam Holzman, Robert Irving III, Kei Akagi, and John Beasley, various bassists, drummers, and percussionists, and on &quot;Amandla,&quot; the tenor of Rick Margitza. Davis is in consistently strong form throughout the numbers, which include &quot;In a Silent Way,&quot; &quot;New Blues,&quot; &quot;Human Nature,&quot; &quot;Tutu,&quot; and &quot;Time After Time.&quot; Quite often the live versions of these songs are more creative and exciting than the ones previously issued. This highly recommended LP's (released in 1996) concludes with one number (&quot;Hannibal&quot;) from Davis' final performance; it is not given a date but is most likely from just a few weeks before his death at age 65. No Miles Davis collection is complete without this important set.\nReview by Scott Yanow (allmusic.com)\n\nTrack listing &amp; Personnel\nA1 In A Silent Way\t1:49 \nBass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Benny

What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to lose any musical information in the process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, &quot;Life is full of surface noises.&quot; In some cases this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria, which is IMO quite high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a835343a55bd4117e36987c7cbce7e9b42cdb5","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Live+Around+The+World+%281996%29%5BVinyl%5D-aksman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a835343a55bd4117e36987c7cbce7e9b42cdb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,168,53,52,58,85,189,65,23,227,105,135,199,203,206,126,155,66,205,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
