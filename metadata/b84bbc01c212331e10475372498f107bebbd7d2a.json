But not millions of years back, to the age of the dinosaur. Not a day back. Not even a minute back.\r\n\r\nWhat if you could only send something back less than the blink of an eye? Would this be of any use? You wouldn't have nearly enough time to right a wrong, change an event, or win a lottery.\r\n\r\nNathan Wexler is a brilliant physicist who thinks he's found a way to send matter a split second back into the past. But before he can even confirm his findings, he and his wife-to-be, Jenna Morrison, find themselves in a battle for their very lives. Because while time travel to an instant earlier seems useless, Jenna comes to learn that no capability in history has ever been more profound or far-reaching.\r\n\r\nNow, as Jenna fights to defeat the powerful forces arrayed against her, nothing less than the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. . .\r\n\r\nContaining a stunningly unique slant on time travel, Split Second is a roller-coaster ride of a thriller, one that will have listeners pondering the natures of time and reality long after the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Kevin Pariseau\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b84bbc01c212331e10475372498f107bebbd7d2a","amp;dn":"Douglas+E.+Richards+-+Split+Second","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b84bbc01c212331e10475372498f107bebbd7d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,75,188,1,194,18,51,30,16,71,83,114,73,143,16,123,235,189,125,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
