In most cases, a description of fundamental distributed algorithms that support mobile hosts in a wireless environment is either not included or is only briefly discussed. Handbook of Algorithms for Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing focuses on several aspects of mobile computing, particularly algorithmic methods and distributed computing with mobile communications capability. This volume provides the topics that are crucial for building the foundation for the design and construction of future generations of mobile and wireless networks, including cellular, wireless ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks. Following an analysis of fundamental algorithms and protocols, the book offers a basic overview of wireless technologies and networks and a discussion of the convergence of communication and computation. Other topics include issues related to mobility, with a focus on the creation of techniques that control associated uncertainties; aspects of QoS provisioning in wireless networks; a comparison of numerous wireless TCP proposals; a review of fundamental algorithms for Bluetooth wireless personal area networks (WPANs); and investigations of future voice and video access networks; and a review of potential applications of pervasive computing and mobile e-commerce.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71646eba341661b0b7622fa10395ba63e864dbd2","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Algorithms+for+Wireless+Networking+and+Mobile+Comput","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71646eba341661b0b7622fa10395ba63e864dbd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,100,110,186,52,22,97,176,183,98,47,161,3,149,186,99,232,100,219,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
