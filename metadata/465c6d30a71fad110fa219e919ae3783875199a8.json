The\nplaying is even more superb, jaw-dropping and spectacular and fun, with changes\nof style, tempo, rhythm, arrangements, with tunes flawlessly merging into one\nanother, with a band of equals that is fully at the same high level, throughout\nthe album, diving and reworking jazz history, swing, blues, full of fun and\ndrive and enthusiasm and raw and rebellious wildness of modern music, fully\nenjoying themselves in the process ... with little jokes and quotes and throwing\nballs around for the other player to catch and pass on flawlessly at breakneck\nspeed to the amusement of the audience.\n\nThe band is Peter Evans on trumpet, Jon Irabagon on sax, Moppa Elliott on bass\nand Kevin Shea on drums.\n\nThe downside of all the fun is the same as with all humor, it creates an\nemotional distance that needs to be bridged in true artistry. It is somehow\nnon-committal, not the expression of real feelings of anger or madness or sorrow\n... but that is clearly not the intention either.\n\nGreat stuff, great fun.\n\n(and did you expect a comment on the Keith Jarrett KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ln Concert art work\nressemblance?)\n\n--\n\nBy Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38873&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38873&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nBy Nuno Catarino (pt)\n\nBy Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2011/03/mostly-other-people-do-killing-coimbra.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2011/03/mostly-other-people-do-killing-coimbra.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2011/03/04/mostly-other-people-do-the-killing-the-coimbra-concert/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2011/03/04/mostly-other-people-do-the-killing-the-coimbra-concert/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:465c6d30a71fad110fa219e919ae3783875199a8","amp;dn":"Mostly+Other+People+Do+The+Killing+-+The+Coimbra+Concert+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"465c6d30a71fad110fa219e919ae3783875199a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,92,109,48,167,31,173,17,15,162,25,233,25,174,55,131,135,81,153,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
