Promotional info for the collected edition - &quot;After the death of a dream comes the return of a legend! Captain America--Steve Rogers is reborn, but is he the hero we know and love? Or is the new Captain merely a pawn of the Red Skull or perhaps something worse? That's what his friends including Sharon Carter, Bucky Barnes, the Black Widow, the Falcon and more must find out before the Skull's master plan comes to fruition! And perhaps worse than the Skull, what is Norman Osborn doing lurking on the fringes?&quot;\n\nThanks to Tyrant Lizard King-Empire for this HD digital copy.
