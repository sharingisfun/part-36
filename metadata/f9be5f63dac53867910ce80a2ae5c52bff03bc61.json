The record captures the wild, unrestrained side of his playing that had never quite been documented before. Though his singing doesn't quite have the fire or power of his playing, the album doesn't suffer at all because of that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he simply burns throughout the album. Ice Pickin' was his first release for Alligator Records and it set the pace for all the albums that followed. No matter how much he tried, Collins never completely regained the pure energy that made Ice Pickin' such a revelation.\nBorn in Leona, Texas, Collins was a distant relative of Lightnin' Hopkins and grew up learning about music and playing guitar. His family moved to Houston, Texas when he was seven. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, he absorbed the blues sounds and styles from Texas, Mississippi and Chicago. His style would soon envelop these sounds.\nHe formed his first band in 1952 and two years later was the headliner at several blues clubs in Houston. By the late 1950s Collins began using Fender Telecasters. He later chose a &quot;maple-cap&quot; 1966 Custom Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucker in the neck position and a 100 watt RMS silverfaced 1970s Fender Quad Reverb combo as his main equipment, and developed a unique sound featuring minor tunings, sustained notes and an &quot;attack&quot; fingerstyle. He also frequently used a capo on his guitar, particularly on the 5th, 7th, and 9th frets. He primarily favored an &quot;open F-minor&quot; tuning (low to high: F-C-F-Ab-C-F).\nCollins began recording in 1960 and released singles, including many instrumentals such as the million selling &quot;Frosty&quot;. In the spring of 1965 he moved to Kansas City, Missouri and made a name for himself.\nMany of Kansas City's recording studios had closed by the mid 1960s. Unable to record, Collins moved to California in 1967. He settled in San Francisco and played many of the venues popular with the counter-culture. In early 1969 after playing a concert with Canned Heat, members of this band introduced him to Liberty Records. In appreciation, CollinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first record title for United Artists &quot;Love Can Be Found Anywhere&quot;, was taken from the lyrics of &quot;Refried Hockey Boogie&quot;. Collins signed and released his first album on Imperial Records, a sister label, in 1968.\nCollins remained in California for another five years, and was popular on double-billed shows at The Fillmore and the Winterland. Collins moved back to Texas in 1973 and formed a new band. He was signed to Alligator Records in 1978 and recorded and released Ice Pickin'. He would record seven more albums with the label, before being signed to Point Blank Records in 1990.\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Collins toured the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. He was becoming a popular blues musician and was an influence for Coco Montoya, Robert Cray, Gary Moore, Debbie Davies, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jonny Lang, Susan Tedeschi, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, John Mayer and Frank Zappa.\nIn 1983, when he won the W. C. Handy Award for his album Don't Lose Your Cool, which won the award for best blues album of the year. In 1985, he shared a Grammy for the album Showdown!, which he recorded with Robert Cray and Johnny Copeland. The following year his solo release Cold Snap was also nominated for a Grammy. In 1987, John Zorn enlisted him to play lead guitar in a suite he had composed especially for him, entitled &quot;Two-Lane Highway,&quot; on Zorn's album Spillane.\nAlongside George Thorogood and the Destroyers and Bo Diddley, Collins performed at Live Aid in 1985, playing &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot; and &quot;Madison Blues&quot;, at the JFK Stadium. He was the only black blues artist to appear.\nCollins was invited to play at the 'Legends Of Guitar Festival' concerts in Seville, Spain at the Expo in 1992, where amongst others, he played &quot;Iceman&quot;, the title track from his final studio album.\n\n\n\nLabel: Alligator\nRelease Date: 1978\nCatalog number: 4713\nEngineer Freddie Breitberg\nRecording Time 38 minutes\nPersonnel\nAlbert Collins - vocals, guitar\nCasey Jones - drums\nLarry Burton - guitar\nAron Burton - bass\nChuck Smith - baritone saxophone\nAlan Batts - keyboards\nAlso: A.C.
