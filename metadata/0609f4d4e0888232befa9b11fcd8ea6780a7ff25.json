In 1979, the young dancer arrived in Texas as part of a cultural exchange, only to fall in love with America-and with an American woman. Two years later, through a series of events worthy of the most exciting cloak-and-dagger fiction, he defected to the United States, where he quickly became known as one of the greatest ballet dancers in the world. This is his story, told in his own inimitable voice.\n\nePub and Mobi formats.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298137.Mao_s_Last_Dancer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298137.Mao_s_Last_Dancer&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0609f4d4e0888232befa9b11fcd8ea6780a7ff25","amp;dn":"Li+Cunxin+-+Mao%27s+Last+Dancer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0609f4d4e0888232befa9b11fcd8ea6780a7ff25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,9,244,212,224,136,130,50,190,250,155,17,252,216,234,103,128,167,255,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
