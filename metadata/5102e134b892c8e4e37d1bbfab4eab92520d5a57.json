He cries for answers. Then he screams as he is torn apart like \ndamp tissue paper. This wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last. \n\nThe police are powerless to stop it, so the duty falls to the only ones who can. \nWhat force could be so powerful - and so malevolent - that it would destroy the \nvery core of a life in order to get what it wants? Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone \nmean to find out, even if it means risking themselves in the process. \n\nJust extract and play.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5102e134b892c8e4e37d1bbfab4eab92520d5a57","amp;dn":"Blackwell.Epiphany.v1.0.Ner0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5102e134b892c8e4e37d1bbfab4eab92520d5a57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,2,225,52,184,146,200,228,227,125,27,191,171,78,171,146,82,13,90,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
