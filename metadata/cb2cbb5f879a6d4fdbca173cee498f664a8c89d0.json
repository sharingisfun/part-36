This is also due to the request of the guy that uploaded Guitar Method 1 (ver.2) many thanks to him! :)\n\nAnyway, as far as I know this is the latest version of intermediate guitar method. Guitar Method 1 is currently in version 3, but the latest version &quot;online&quot; is v.2 So if anyone might happen to have version 3, plz upload it :)\n\nThis CD brings the intermediate course, if u want the beginners course, it&amp;#039;s available here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3505761/eMedia_Guitar_Method_1_(v.2)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3505761/eMedia_Guitar_Method_1_(v.2)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n    * Music Notation or Tablature: Every screen can be displayed in either guitar tablature or standard music notation with an       easily accessible menu option.\n    * Full Motion Video: Professional guitar instructor Kevin Garry, Ph.D., guides you in over 30 videos with demonstrations of \t      techniques.\n    * Animated Fretboard: Displays fingering positions as the music plays.\n    * Automatic Tuner: Tune your guitar quickly and easily. A precision gauge allows you to play into your computer&amp;#039;s microphone \t      and immediately get feedback to see if you&amp;#039;re too high or too low.\n    * Chord Dictionary: Includes fingering charts and recorded sounds for over 1000 chords. Easy access helps you learn songs with \t      new chords quickly. An indispensable reference tool!\n\n\n\nhere is a sample of a user review of the product:\n\n&quot;Intermediate Guitar Method is incredible! Unlike Guitar Method 2 it has an animated fretboard just like in GM1. It has also expanded it&amp;#039;s lesson library from 85 to 175 lessons. It has an expanded chord dictionary with over 1,000 chords providing sound for each chord (a huge step up from GM1&amp;#039;s 250 chord dictionary). What I didn&amp;#039;t like about GM1 was that it seemed to focus on using the acoustic guitar. Many of the recordings (Clapton, Hendrix) in IGM are played with an electric, which offers a nice balance between the two. The techniques that are learned in IGM are advanced, but I&amp;#039;m convinced that there is no other software available that will make them easier to learn or more enjoyable to play.&quot;\n\nGM1 = Guitar Method 1\nGM2 = ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2cbb5f879a6d4fdbca173cee498f664a8c89d0","amp;dn":"eMedia+Intermediate+Guitar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2cbb5f879a6d4fdbca173cee498f664a8c89d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,44,187,95,135,154,109,79,219,202,23,60,238,73,143,102,74,140,137,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
