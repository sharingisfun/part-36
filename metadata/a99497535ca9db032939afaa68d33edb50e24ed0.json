This CD had a limited 'pressing', sold out quickly, and fans have been hunting for it ever since.   \nThis torrent shares that CD. music from Invader ZiM. All are high quality (between 128 and 224 kpbs). Also included are three .JPG scans of the cover, insert and CD. \nThe music itself has that wonderful, threatening tone to it which helped make the show so insane. \nThe torrent is not archived, no need to unRAR or unZIP. And if you like it, write and bug the hell out of Nickelodeon so they re-release this CD!\n\nNOTE: This is not a copy of ZiMPhony. I do have ZiMPhony and will be releasing it on The Pirate Bay soon. \n\nTracklist:\n\nInvader ZiM Main Title  0:39\nIn the Beginning  1:53\nEntering Earth's Atmosphere  0:26\nBestest Friend  0:47\nCarnival Nightmares  0:25\nHarvester ZiM  0:32\nDark Harvest Chase  2:15\nParent Waltz  0:56\nParents Crack  1:21\nBank Robber Chase  1:13\nCarne Beat  0:18\nZiM Loses It  1:10\nCombat Montage  2:19\nKiller Bee  1:09\nEscape On the Pig  1:41\nBuilding Montage  1:06\nWater Park Showdown  1:16\nDib Meets Mentor  0:54\nDrum 'N' Thing  1:55\nZiM Saves Earth  1:27\nDib's Piggy Doom  0:53\nGIR Hypnotized  1:27\nGIR's Circus  0:19\nHouse On The Move  1:02\nPlan Revealed To Dib  0:39\nPhotos Of Shame  0:13\nUltra Peepi Showdown  2:22\nBaby Alien Mission  1:07\nZiM's Getaway   0:49\nGaz's Mission  1:06\nPoop Doggy Dog  0:55\nDa Dog Visits  0:49\nReveal Da Dog  0:37\nRankles Wrinkle  0:41\nKitty Rally  0:31\nMeats Of Evil  0:55\nAngry Gaz  1:22\nZiM Reports In  1:07\nBattle Of the Planets  1:38\nMysterious Mysteries Theme  1:03\nZiM's Escape  1:00\nHobo's Theme  0:23\nGear Fight  1:24\nDib's Missions  1:15\nSo Sad  0:21\nScary Gaz  0:39 \nChicken Chase  0:52\nLibrary Hunt  1:20 \nHappy Fun Ball  1:16\nLice Squad 1:10\nGhosts  0:34\nIt's On! 1:11\nHappy Day?  0:24  \nIt's Love  0:43\nTak's Theme  1:24\nOne Big Video Game  2:37\nHappy Cookie Beast  1:03\nFoodcourtia  1:17\nSizz Chase  2:53\nSuper Waffles  0:44\nNext Evil Plan 0:44 \nSpider Dib  1:16\nMembrane Tests  1:11\nCurse You!  0:30\nGaz and The Shadowhog  2:11\nAliens In The Sky  1:08\nWillie's Rise To Power  1:16\nSource Music Of Doom   2:22\nInvader ZiM End Credits  0:48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a99497535ca9db032939afaa68d33edb50e24ed0","amp;dn":"Invader+ZiM+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a99497535ca9db032939afaa68d33edb50e24ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,148,151,83,92,169,219,3,41,57,175,170,104,211,62,219,80,226,78,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
