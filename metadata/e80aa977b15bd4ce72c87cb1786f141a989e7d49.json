They had honed their skills playing for two years straight, five nights a week as an opening act for bands like Journey, The Moody Blues and legend Tina Turner. This concert is their triumphant return to their home country playing 4 nights all sold out which was a record at The Forum at that time.\n\nThis concert features all five original members, Al Connelly, Alan Frew, Michael Hanson, Wayne Parker, and Sam Reid. The concert covers their entire debut album 'The Thin Red Line', minus the instrumental 'The Secret', plus one new song, 'After The Dance', that you don't see until they put out the 'Air Time' Album which was their Best of CD released in 1994.\n\nSet list:\n1. Ancient Evenings\n2. I Will be There\n3. Closer To You\n4. Thin Red Line\n5. Someday\n6. Vanishing Tribe\n7. After The Dance\n8. Ecstasy\n9. You're What I Look For\n10. Looking At A Picture\n11.
