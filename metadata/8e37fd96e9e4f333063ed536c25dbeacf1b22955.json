Each week the celebrities will look fear in the face as they leap off the 10-meter high dive, pair off to complete synchronized stunts, and flip, twist and spin into the depths of the pool below. Leading up to the competition, the world's most decorated and medaled diving legend, Greg Louganis, will give each celebrity weeks of training. Each dive will be critiqued by the judges, London Olympic U.S. Gold medalist David Boudia and Australian Olympic athlete and USA Dive Team director Steve Foley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e37fd96e9e4f333063ed536c25dbeacf1b22955","amp;dn":"splash.s01e06.720p.hdtv.x264-2hd.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e37fd96e9e4f333063ed536c25dbeacf1b22955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,55,253,150,233,228,243,51,6,62,213,54,194,93,190,172,241,178,41,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
