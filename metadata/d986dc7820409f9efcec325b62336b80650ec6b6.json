Chalmers Johnson, an authority on Japan and its economy, offers a troubling prognosis of what's to come. Blowback--the title refers to a CIA neologism describing the unintended consequences of American activity--is a call for the United States to rethink its position in the world. &quot;The evidence is building up that in the decade following the end of the Cold War, the United States largely abandoned a reliance on diplomacy, economic aid, international law, and multilateral institutions in carrying out its foreign policies and resorted much of the time to bluster, military force, and financial manipulation,&quot; writes Johnson. &quot;The world is not a safer place as a result.&quot; Individual chapters focus on Okinawa (where American servicemen were accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in &quot;Asia's last colony&quot;, the two Koreas, China, and Japan. The result is a liberal-leaning (and Asia-centric) call for the United States to disengage from many of its global commitments. Critics will call Johnson an isolationist, but friends (perhaps admirers of Patrick Buchanan's A Republic, Not an Empire) will say he simply speaks good sense. All will agree he is an earnest voice: &quot;I believe our very hubris ensures our undoing.&quot;\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nThis no-holds-barred indictment of what Johnson calls the post-Cold War American &quot;global empire&quot; is not for the faint of heart. Among the opening images is a plastic bag containing three pairs of bloodied men's underwear gathered as evidence from the brutal 1995 gang rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl by two American marines and an American sailor, a crime that was officially passed off as an aberration but may qualify more accurately as another move in the endgame of, in Johnson's astringent phrase, &quot;stealth imperialism.&quot; In his highly critical appraisal of the global U.S. military presence, Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research Institute and prolific commentator on Japan and Asia, focuses on the effects of &quot;blowback,&quot; a term coined by the CIA to denote the unintended consequences of policies that were in many cases kept secret from the American public. From anti-Chinese pogroms carried out by U.S.-trained soldiers in Indonesia to the viciously suppressed 1980 pro-democracy demonstration in Kwangju, South Korea, Johnson examines the fallout from what he sees as American &quot;economic colonialism.&quot; Detailed assessments of American engagement in Japan, Korea and China are coupled with closer-to-home observations on the liquidation of American jobs in places such as Birmingham, Ala., and Pittsburgh, the latter yet another consequence of the massive U.S. trade deficit with the countries of East Asia. Brazenly spending ever-swollen defense budgets, Johnson argues, the Pentagon is fueling an &quot;antiglobalization time bomb&quot; that could blow up at any moment. His chilling conclusion--backed by copious and livid detail--is that a nation reaps precisely what it sows..\n\n\nBook 2 - The Sorrows of Empire - Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic.\n\n\n\n\nSince September 2001, the United States has &quot;undergone a transformation from republic to empire that may well prove irreversible,&quot; writes Chalmers Johnson. Unlike past global powers, however, America has built an empire of bases rather than colonies, creating in the process a government that is obsessed with maintaining absolute military dominance over the world, Johnson claims. The Department of Defense currently lists 725 official U.S. military bases outside of the country and 969 within the 50 states (not to mention numerous secret bases). According to the author, these bases are proof that the &quot;United States prefers to deal with other nations through the use or threat of force rather than negotiations, commerce, or cultural interaction.&quot; This rise of American militarism, along with the corresponding layers of bureaucracy and secrecy that are created to circumvent scrutiny, signals a shift in power from the populace to the Pentagon: &quot;A revolution would be required to bring the Pentagon back under democratic control,&quot; he writes.\n\nIn Sorrows of Empire, Johnson discusses the roots of American militarism, the rise and extent of the military-industrial complex, and the close ties between arms industry executives and high-level politicians. He also looks closely at how the military has extended the boundaries of what constitutes national security in order to centralize intelligence agencies under their control and how statesmen have been replaced by career soldiers on the front lines of foreign policy--a shift that naturally increases the frequency with which we go to war.\n\nThough his conclusions are sure to be controversial, Johnson is a skilled and experienced historian who backs up his claims with copious research and persuasive arguments. His important book adds much to a debate about the realities and direction of U.S. influence in the world.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nIn his prescient 2000 bestseller, Blowback, East Asia scholar Johnson predicted dire consequences for a U.S. foreign policy that had run roughshod over Asia. Now he joins a chorus of Bush critics in this provocative, detailed tour of what he sees as America's entrenched culture of militarism, its &quot;private army&quot; of special forces and its worldwide archipelago of military &quot;colonies.&quot; According to Johnson, before a mute public and Congress, oil and arms barons have displaced the State Department, secretly creating &quot;a military juggernaut intent on world domination&quot; and are exercising &quot;preemptive intervention&quot; for &quot;oil, Israel, and... to fulfill our self-perceived destiny as a New Rome.&quot; Johnson admits that Bill Clinton, who disguised his policies as globalization, was a &quot;much more effective imperialist,&quot; but most of the book assails &quot;the boy emperor&quot; Bush and his cronies with one of the most startling and engrossing accounts of exotic defense capabilities, operations and spending in print, though these assertions are not new and not always assiduously sourced. Fans of Blowback will be pleased despite Johnson's lack of remedies other than &quot;a revolution&quot; in which &quot;the people could retake control of Congress..\n\n\nBook 3 - Nemesis - The Last Days of the American Republic (2007)\n\n\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nLike ancient Rome, America is saddled with an empire that is fatally undermining its republican government, argues Johnson (The Sorrows of Empire), in this bleak jeremiad. He surveys the trappings of empire: the brutal war of choice in Iraq and other foreign interventions going back decades; the militarization of space; the hundreds of overseas U.S. military bases full of &quot;swaggering soldiers who brawl and sometimes rape.&quot; At home, the growth of an &quot;imperial presidency,&quot; with the CIA as its &quot;private army,&quot; has culminated in the Bush administration's resort to warrantless wiretaps, torture, a &quot;gulag&quot; of secret CIA prisons and an unconstitutional arrogation of &quot;dictatorial&quot; powers, while a corrupt Congress bows like the Roman Senate to Caesar. Retribution looms, the author warns, as the American economy, dependent on a bloated military-industrial complex and foreign borrowing, staggers toward bankruptcy, maybe a military coup. Johnson's is a biting, often effective indictment of some ugly and troubling features of America's foreign policy and domestic politics. But his doom-laden trope of empire (&quot;the capacity for things to get worse is limitless.... the American republic may be coming to its end&quot; seems overstated. With Bush a lame duck, not a Caesar, and his military adventures repudiated by the electorate, the Republic seems more robust than Johnson allows.\n\nThe third book in a series begun with Blowback (2000), which predicted harsh comeuppance for the post-cold war American &quot;global empire,&quot; and The Sorrows of Empire (2004), which continued Johnson's thesis with a lambasting of American militarism pre- and post-September 11, this book continues the author's broad condemnation of American foreign policy by warning of imminent constitutional and economic collapse. In a chapter analyzing &quot;comparative imperial pathologies,&quot; Johnson reminds readers of Hannah Arendt's point that successful imperialism requires that democratic systems give way to tyranny and asserts that the U.S. must choose between giving up its empire of military bases (as did Britain after World War II) or retaining the bases at the expense of its democracy (as did Rome). Johnson also predicts dire consequences should the U.S. continue to militarize low Earth orbits in pursuit of security. To some extent a timely response to recent arguments in favor of American empire, such as those of Niall Ferguson in Colossus, this account also reiterates Johnson's perennial concerns about overseas military bases, the CIA, and the artifice of a defense-fueled economy...\n\n\nDismantling the Empire: America's Last Best Hope\n\n\n\nThat the empire has caused much trouble and is in trouble itself has been well documented and well explained by many current authors. Chalmers Johnson, who wrote Blowback - at the time an unheralded piece of research - and two more volumes, Sorrows of Empire and Nemesis that became the Blowback trilogy, has since written a series of essays that are concise, clear, hard-hitting, and undeniably for Dismantling the Empire.\n\nThe essential theme of the book is that the U.S. must dismantle its empire or face a future of poverty and strife within a divided nation. As these essays were written over a period of five years, there is some reiteration of information - particularly on the military bases and their costs and effects on the economy (not to mention all the other costs to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“hostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ countries). Yet that only reinforces the significance of JohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thesis, as the numbers are somewhat astounding for their significance with both foreign and domestic policy. As the title indicates, to save the U.S. as a democratic republic, the empire must be dismantled. If notÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nSaving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThere are three main points that Johnson presents his arguments on:\n\n1) the CIA should be shut down.\n\n2) the overseas military bases need to be dismantled.\n\n3) economy - the pork-barrelling of politicians within the military-industrial complex also needs to be shut down.\n\nStraight forward. Basic. Logical. Not elegant, but very simple - at least for conception. If these actions are not taken, Johnson argues, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlong-standing reliance on imperialism and militarism in our relations with other countries and the vast, potentially ruinous global empire of bases that goes with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will lead to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa devastating trio of consequences: imperial overstretch, perpetual war, and insolvency, leading to a likely collapse similar to that of the former Soviet Union.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nFor anyone following current events covering the environment, the economy, and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwar on terrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlong warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, these conclusions should be obvious. The introduction ends, commenting, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNone of this [is] inevitable, although it may [be] unavoidable given the hubris and arrogance of our national leadership.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe CIA - A Private Presidential Army\n\nThe CIA is covered in three of the essays, two directly related to its ineptitude. The first essay, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlowback World,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ focuses on events that led into U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan, beginning with the CIAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s introduction into covert actions in Afghanistan six months before the Soviet invasion. The CIA was supposedly an intelligence gathering and assessment operation, but included ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa vaguely worded passage that allowed the CIA to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œperform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time directÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - that turned the CIA into the personal, secret, unaccountable army of the president.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe CIAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ineptitude is evident in many areas, from 9/11 through the war on Iraq, and the current imbroglios in Afghanistan and Pakistan (from imbroglio: a complicated and embarrassing state of things; a serious misunderstanding, WebsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dictionary). Johnson says of the analysis and sharing of information, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe early-warning functions of the CIA were upstaged decades ago by covert operations.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Even then, the main ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“successesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of the CIA derived not from skill or intelligence but handfuls of greenbacks. His conclusion: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI believe the CIA has outlived any Cold War justification it once might have had and should simply be abolished.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis is reiterated in the second essay on the CIA, a review of Tim WeinerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA, where the conclusion is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe CIA has failed badlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and it would be an important stepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦simply to abolish it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ As for the security of the country being enhanced, after the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“blowbackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ effects of the Mossadegh coup, all the coups and para-military police training in torture and assassination at the School of the Americas, and the Afghanistan mujahideen assistance against the Soviets indicates, the lesson is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthat an incompetent or unscrupulous intelligence agency can be as great a threat to national security as not having one at all.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMilitary Bases\n\nJohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prime target has been the extensive military bases that encircle the globe. The reason for these bases ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œis to expand our empire and reinforce our military domination of the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The question then is, why dominate the world militarily? Consumption. Money. Resources. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOur empire exists so we can exploit a much greater share of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wealth than we are entitled to, and so we can prevent other nations from combining against us to take their rightful share.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAfter all his arguments about the costs of the bases, their effects on other nations and their people, Johnson is even more direct with his evaluation of the outcome if the bases are not dismantled: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhanging on to our military empire and all the bases that go with it will ultimately spell the end of the United States as we know it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe third factor that is the basic one for all the arguments about the decline and fall of the empire is economic. This concern can be sub-texted in several ways: the costs of the mercenary armies; the pork-barrel economy of a Congress that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œis no longer responsive to the people;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the military bases as introduced above; and the industrial economy based within the Pentagon.\n\nJohnson reiterates that the military economy of the U.S. is more than that of all the other world militaries combined, with many unknowns including the black hole of the unaccountable Pentagon. Another factor is the money used for the military is money not used for infrastructure of anything else like hospitals, transportation, education, or a social safety net, all of which would be much more highly beneficial to the people of the United States. It is impossible to know what ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“innovationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ would or would not have risen from technological knowledge, although previous histories would indicate that technology that has helped humans has operated more or less independently of the various imperial armies of the past. Money spent on the military - in spite of the pork-barrel politics that disperses the money around every state in many different industries from Lockheed Martin and Boeing to Kodak and Intel to garner leverage for votes in congress - does not help the economy, but hinders its growth.\n\nOne of the largest factors for the economy is the sheer size of the budget for the military, estimated at over a trillion dollars a year, all of which needs to be borrowed from foreign countries. China and Japan are major owners of U.S. debt and could sink the U.S. dollar in an instant if that were required due to unexpected military adventurism that appeared to be endangering their rising prosperity. The consequences of the U.S. military economy is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe face probable national insolvency and a long depressionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.the bankruptcy of the United States is inevitable.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe military economy is also affected by the current trend in privatization of garrisoning the bases, the employment of private security firms, and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“public-privateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ partnerships in U.S. corporate structures that are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDemocracy\n\nThe corporate sector has become a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdominant partner with the state,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fulfilling the argument that fascism should be called corporatism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbecause it was a merger of state and corporate power.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa corporation [is] less amenable to public or congressional scrutiny,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ these relationships ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œafford the private sector an added measure of security from [public] scrutiny.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The main motive of big business is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œto replace democratic institutions with those representing the interests of capital.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This latter point is obvious when the institutions of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Washington consensusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - the IMF, World Bank - and other more obvious corporate entities such as the WTO and the OECD are deciding many of the rules of international economic interaction.\n\nAll of which means that democracy is taking a hit. Johnson is quite clear and explicit in the matter - the United States can either be an empire, or it can be a democracy, it cannot be both. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconsequences for democratic governanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmilitary and intelligence functionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.may prove irreparable.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDecline and Fall\n\nCould it be made any more clear? Chalmers Johnson has not pulled any punches, nor worded his arguments in polite academic arguments or obscure wording. It seems so simple and obvious to some that serious changes are required if the U.S. is to be a democracy and a model to the rest of the world rather than an imperial overlord extracting resources at the expense of many lives, the democratic ideal, and much anger and hatred directed at the U.S. Using examples of the British and Soviet empires, Johnson concludes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf we do not learn from their examples, our decline and fall is foreordained.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ [italics added]\n\nJohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longer works provide ample evidence and arguments to back up his shorter essays (which are also well referenced). Dismantle the Empire is a must read for anyone looking for a quick, concise, and meaningful information concerning the future of the American Empire.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThese are open bittorrent trackers, so yes anyone can announce anything on\nthem, please include them in all your torrents.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://concen.cc/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://concen.cc/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://concen.cc/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://umunu.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://umunu.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://umunu.com/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://umu.mu/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://umu.mu/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://umu.mu/announce\n\nSend tips to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;177d7872757b786057627a6279623974787a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or call skype:joeblowman\t\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d986dc7820409f9efcec325b62336b80650ec6b6","amp;dn":"%5Bconcen.cc%5D+Gaza+-+Killing+ZoneBlowback+Trilogy+%2B+Dismantling+th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d986dc7820409f9efcec325b62336b80650ec6b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,134,220,120,32,64,159,158,252,236,50,91,98,51,107,128,101,14,198,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
