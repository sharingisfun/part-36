Broers, however, sees this not as an impending apocalypse but as the dawn of a new era.\n\nDrawing on research from a variety of disciplines, he shows how erupting solar activity carries the potential to boost our brain capacity and expand our minds in ways we never imagined possible. Abilities now seen as extraordinary or supernatura - telepathy, extrasensory perception, and off-the-charts intelligence quotients - may soon become ordinary and natural and could very well help us solve the mounting global crises we are facing.\n\nWithout a doubt, the way we think, feel, relate, communicate, and experience reality has been changing dramatically in recent years, and Dieter Broers affirms those changes will ultimately culminate in a new form of consciousness and harmony on Earth. Humankind is going through an evolutionary leap, says Broers, and the process has already begun.\n\nFeaturing: DIETER BROERS, RUPERT SHELDRAKE, MICHAEL PERSINGER, ERNST SENKOWSKI, MICHAEL KÃƒâ€“NIG, ILLOBRAND VON LUDWIGER, ELIZABETH RAUSCHER, ROLLIN MCCRATY, FRANZ HALBERG, GIULIANA CONFORTO, JJ &amp; DESIREE HURTAK, FRANCINE BLAKE, and RICK STRASSMAN.\n\nDVDRip 720x400 100min ENGLISH ACC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da7b1f41339491d0a9cb565937bc38bed0fb1cab","amp;dn":"Solar.Revolution%282012%29.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da7b1f41339491d0a9cb565937bc38bed0fb1cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,123,31,65,51,148,145,208,169,203,86,89,55,188,56,190,208,251,28,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
