Can be anything. A feeling, a recollection, a person. This time it was PR. Obama. And something strange happened. I realized I created a way to reach this guy. I have a plan and he must hear it. But this can only be told when asked for it. Someone has to wake up. With music I can wake him. But I need your help spreading the list so that this sound-massage reaches him. Music tells a lot. If he hears (feels) the same honesty, I do, he will come up with the right question.\n\nMaybe a strange thought, but is it? Say our future depends on it. You may start laughing. But letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just say. Would you then download these magnificent playlist, prepared with the most care, my most loved VHQ tracks, Sweet and classy and spread this sound-message. If we believe, it will be done. Yes we (still) can.\n\nI only have to let go,\n\nEnjoy, Dutch Treat.\n\n\nSweetlist 17 Dear Mr. President (Jazzy Pop)\n\n01 - The Air That I Breathe (Alexis Jordan)\n02 - The Last Chance Texaco (Rickie Lee Jones)\n03 - There Is Still Hope (Everette Harp)\n04 - So What!
