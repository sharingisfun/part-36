You can hardly find anything illegal on google or other search engines and with internet profits going through the roof audible and partners still dare to ask crazy prizes even though profits have never been higher. I'm sorry but 25 dollars for one audiobook is just insane, even if the book is made by awesome Mark Tufo. I don't mind paying for Mark Tufo's books because I really enjoy them but that doesn't mean audible can just rip my dick off. If we really wanna keep the option of free stuff we have to keep sharing.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nNow about the new Mark Tufo book:\n\n\nMark Tufo - Zombie Fallout Series (Audiobooks):\n\nCollected and uploaded by: Jimi88 - Netherlands\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n7) For the Fallen:\n------------------\nMike is back. The battle with Eliza is past. \nNow Mike must strike out once again in a desperate race against time as his son \nand best friend are succumbing to the zombie virus within them. \nWhat he does not know is that an old foe hasrisen up and a more insidious threat has emerged \nto not just the Talbots but all of humanity. \n\n------------------\nNarrator: Sean Runnette\nListening Length: 10 hours and 55 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Mark Tufo\nAudible.com Release Date: November 12, 2013\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00GIYDPEK\n----------------\n\nI give these series an 9/10 because it's a great read/listen and even though the massive lenght never seems to bore the reader/listener.\nTogether with Warm Bodies, The Armageddon Series and The Morningstar Strain this series is in my personal top 10.\n\nHave Fun and if you love the audiobook buy the paper! \n\nGreetz Jimi\n\nPS. I haven't listened to this new one yet so please comment on the quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba6f78d1e1164700d9c621f2349f6a4d380f6d14","amp;dn":"Mark+Tufo+-+Zombie+Fallout+7%3A+For+the+Fallen+%28Audiobooks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba6f78d1e1164700d9c621f2349f6a4d380f6d14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,111,120,209,225,22,71,0,217,198,33,242,52,159,106,77,56,15,109,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
