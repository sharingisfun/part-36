Install Alcohol 52% free trial and make sure A.C.I.D. that comes with it is the latest version (1.2.10090)\n2. Mount this image on Alcohol 52% or Daemon Tools Lite virtual drive\n3. Cloak virtual drives with A.C.I.D from Alcohol program group\n4a. If you don't have previous ARMA2:OA or ARMA2:CO and want to play only these new DLCs from this DVD, run AutoRun from DVD and proceed with installation\n4b. If you have ARMA2:OA or ARMA2:CO installed, install DLCs from this DVD with this utility (original setup for DLCs only is messed up):\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf SecuRom detects virtual drive with error 2500, try adding more virtual drives (don't forget to use A.C.I.D.). For me it worked with A52 having one, and DTL having 3, and mounting on 2nd or 3rd DTL drive, but not the 1st one. I didn't change any advanced emulation settings - all were disabled. Also you might try running &quot;SecuROM Removal Tool&quot; between tries.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. When asked for CD-key, use this keygen: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6405788/ArmA_II___OA___RFT_multi_keygen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6405788/ArmA_II___OA___RFT_multi_keygen&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThanks to needlefeet for the tip, themabus for the keygen and thanks to original uploader of this image!\n\nP.S. \nIf TPB shows few seeders, try downloadining .torrent anyway. On May 30 there were about 60. TPB removes most trackers from .torrent file but you'll connect to those peers through peer exchange.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:619e3ac3e07a1f4eb80c73a700f57141266f7241","amp;dn":"ARMA+II+Reinforcements+%28good%2Fworking%2FFADE-free+copy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"619e3ac3e07a1f4eb80c73a700f57141266f7241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,158,58,195,224,122,31,78,184,12,115,167,0,245,113,65,38,111,114,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
