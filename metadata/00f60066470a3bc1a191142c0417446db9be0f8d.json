The authors discuss trends in hardware, methods, and algorithms; parallel computer architectures and the overall system view of a parallel computer; message-passing; parallelization via multi-threading; measures for predicting and assessing the performance of parallel algorithms; and fundamental issues of designing and implementing parallel programs.\n\nThe second part contains detailed discussions and performance analyses of parallel algorithms for a number of important and widely used quantum chemistry procedures and methods. The book presents schemes for the parallel computation of two-electron integrals, details the HartreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fock procedure, considers the parallel computation of second-order MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸llerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Plesset energies, and examines the difficulties of parallelizing local correlation methods.\n\nThrough a solid assessment of parallel computing hardware issues, parallel programming practices, and implementation of key methods, this invaluable book enables readers to develop efficient quantum chemistry software capable of utilizing large-scale parallel computers. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f60066470a3bc1a191142c0417446db9be0f8d","amp;dn":"Parallel+Computing+in+Quantum+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f60066470a3bc1a191142c0417446db9be0f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,246,0,102,71,10,59,193,161,145,20,44,4,23,68,109,185,190,15,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
