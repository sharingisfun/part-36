Landing in an unnatural position takes a lot of faith. Dreams come true if only temporarily, as the girls try on the famed DCC uniform for the first time. It's a make or break fitting for some. If you don't look good in the uniform, it is a deal breaker for Kelli, and that includes the vets. Courtney is stressed to the max because she needs to work and has no time to practice. At the Social Media Seminar, the girls find out why Facebook isn't their friend. Melissa Rycroft and Kitty make a surprise visit to Valley Ranch. Melissa looks to mentor and Kitty to cut. This is also the first week of cuts. The ending of a dream is very painful. \n\nOnce again, nobody wants to see Little Debbie shaking her cakes on the field, put the snacky cakes down girlfriend... I'm a chick so I can say that, lol\n\nEnjoy!\n\n420","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3687590e218429583f59c50433f53527d07ac1c","amp;dn":"Dallas+Cowboys+Cheerleaders+Making+The+Team+S09E04+Week+Firsts+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3687590e218429583f59c50433f53527d07ac1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,104,117,144,226,24,66,149,131,245,156,80,67,63,83,82,125,7,172,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
