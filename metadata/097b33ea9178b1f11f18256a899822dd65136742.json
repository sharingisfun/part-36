It's in Spanish but it's not Spanish music: it's pure rock and roll.\n With a strong Celtic influence, you can hear U2 and Big Country,\n Los Heroes also incorporates the Byrds, the Doors and INXS.\n Not to be missed by serious rock music lovers.\n Forget the MTV basura out there today, there are people in the world who\n haven't forgotten how to make great rock and roll, Los Heroes are such folk.\n (customer review at amazon.com)\n\n\n\nEven so, in the 90's they were regularly broadcasting their beautiful\n clips (do try and find &quot;Maldito Duende&quot; 's!) on MTV's Headbangers' Ball\n (don't know about nowadays, as I don't have MTV anymore).\nBy the way, there's nothing latin about either their music or the band,\n as one reviewer's title implied - they're from Spain, Europe.\nThe category is Hard Rock / Metal, and subcategory is melodic hard rock.\n Sometimes explosive, always powerful, full of punch,\n it is also always highly melodic and harmonious, never discordant or unbalanced,\n nor like &quot; a weight on your nerves&quot;.\nI have to repeat that the vocals are incredible,\n almost unmatched for richness and modulations combined with power.\n The instrumentation does them justice. What a bunch of well matching talented artists.\n[ Un duende te invita a sonar... invites you to dream, Jul 2 2004\nBy E. &quot;cactusjelly&quot; (Europe) (amazon.com)\n\n\n&quot;Senderos de TraiciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n&quot; (Paths of Treason) by the fantastic Heroes\n del Silencio is a great rock album anywhere in the world.\nThey here provide a killer combo of all their best\n qualities:Enrique Bunbury's spellbinding voice is at its best\n and dovetails neatly with Juan Valdivia's slightly celtic\n influenced guitar playing creating an unquestionably original sound.\nThe opener&quot;Entre dos Tierras&quot;is possibly the best track in here with its epic\n scope and compelling chorus but the record doesn't flag throughout,\n with the high points coming one after the other.\n &quot;Maldito Duende&quot;is a dark ballad ,unsurpassable in its appeal.\n &quot;Malas Intenciones&quot;is where Bunbury really shines and his\n pronunciation of&quot;MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s de un segundo en ti&quot;in the track's coda wins the song by itself.\n &quot;Senda&quot;is another great track and as powerful as they ever got.\n &quot;OraciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n&quot;brings back their surfacing emotions and send them to a new high.\nAll in all superb and possibly the best set of songs ever delivered\n by one of the top bands the movement of spanish sung rock has yet produced.\nBy Tezcatlipoca ( amazon.com)\n\n\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy our releases and help us with sharing, please.\n\n\n\n\nPeak level 94.1 %\n     Range quality 100.0 %\n     Test CRC 9ECE53AB\n     Copy CRC 9ECE53AB\n     Copy OK\n\nNo errors occurred\n\n \nAccurateRip summary\n \nTrack  1  not present in database\nTrack  2  not present in database\nTrack  3  not present in database\nTrack  4  not present in database\nTrack  5  not present in database\nTrack  6  not present in database\nTrack  7  not present in database\nTrack  8  not present in database\nTrack  9  not present in database\nTrack 10  not present in database\nTrack 11  not present in database\nTrack 12  not present in database\n \nNone of the tracks are present in the AccurateRip database","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:097b33ea9178b1f11f18256a899822dd65136742","amp;dn":"H%C3%83%C2%A9roes+Del+Silencio+-+Senderos+De+Traici%C3%83%C2%B2n+%281990%29%5BEac+Flac+Cue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"097b33ea9178b1f11f18256a899822dd65136742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,123,51,234,145,120,177,241,31,24,37,106,137,152,34,221,101,19,103,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
