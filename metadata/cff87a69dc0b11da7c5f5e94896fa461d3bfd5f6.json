The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.\n\n\n\n\n4)  Bullship \nWhen livestock hits the uShip auction, Jennifer makes her move and wins a haul of two bucking bulls, while Marc gets a fragile experimental aircraft. When this experienced cowgirl picks up the bulls, she finds them meaner than she expected and ends up having to board them every night she's in transit. Shipping them becomes less of a concern for her than just keeping them alive. Marc gets the Gyrocopter loaded up, but when he decides to swap trailers mid run, he leaves behind some important pieces of the load that jeopardizes his entire shipment\n\n5)  Pain in the Caboose \nWhen it comes to the biggest and baddest loads, Marc can't help but throw his hat in the ring. Fighting off Scott and Susie, he lands the job hauling a 1928 train caboose. When he arrives, Marc finds more of a remodel project than a shipment, and has to get to work right away. Pushing the limits, this load could make him a small fortune, or sink his ship before he makes it across the country.\n\n6)  Camel in Tow \nJennifer uses her experience transporting livestock to win a camel shipment from Oklahoma to Vermont. Between getting lost, stopping to keep her cargo fed, and cleaning up the camel spit, Jennifer gets way behind schedule. But when her truck breaks down mid-run, the whole shipment is jeopardized.\n\n7)  Tavern on the Greenbacks \nRoy heads back in to New York City when he outbids the other transporters for a job moving a catering food truck from the city's famous restaurant, Tavern On the Green. When he arrives and finds the truck in non-operational condition, Roy quickly becomes a mechanic and machine shop worker, but tensions rise when the buyer isn't willing to pay him for his extra work. Jarrett picks up a 400-lb wooden African sculpture that should make for easy money, but when he's forced to repair his not-so-trusty cargo van, he must find additional loads to stay in the black\n\n8)  Jennifers Arch \nJennifer may have taken her livestock specialty too far when she tops the transporters in an auction to ship a number of small animals. Between the smell, the constant feedings, and the never-ending squeals, it may be the last run Jennifer makes with so many critters. Jarrett outbids Marc in the competition to haul a go-kart in the shape of a miniature semi-tractor trailer. Moving it up the coast, he must deliver the tiny automobile in time for a local Shriner event, which will feature an entire fleet of mini semis turned go-karts. But when his van breaks down once again, it may be the last straw for this rookie's unreliable transportation\n\n9)  Baja or Bust \nMarc is headed to Mexico when he wins an auction to ship a $100,000 Baja 1000 Trophy Truck. Leaving from Colorado, Marc must protect his precious cargo, and make sure it arrives without delay in time for the start of the famous race. But when he gets lost on the small back roads in Tijuana, Marc must get resourceful or risk putting the race team, and his career, in last place. Scott and Susie take their boat hauling knowledge to a whole new level when they transport a wooden pirate ship across the southwest. But as they put the miles behind them, the fragile pirate ship gets more and more difficult to keep tied down.\n\n10)  May the Ship be with You \nRoy lands the shipment of his dreams when he gets to haul some large one-of-a-kind props from his favourite sci-fi movie. But when he is cut-off by another trucker on the highway, he's afraid it may have damaged these priceless movie artifacts. Jennifer outbids fellow rookie, Jarrett, for a shipment of 20 peacocks headed to Arizona. With the exotic birds confined to small boxes for transport, she must cover nearly two thousand miles in three days, otherwise Jennifer risks killing the fowl from the stress of travelling.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/972/qd2z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/972/qd2z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/2961/cf6v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/2961/cf6v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3715/roj3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3715/roj3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9871/zagu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9871/zagu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/174/2fla.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/174/2fla.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1090/hnxk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1090/hnxk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/1446/5xxx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/1446/5xxx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/5030/l0yc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/5030/l0yc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8198/ddf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8198/ddf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5a12333d321a1669746a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2145 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 22mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: average 323 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/print.php?ID=58928&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/print.php?ID=58928&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff87a69dc0b11da7c5f5e94896fa461d3bfd5f6","amp;dn":"Shipping+Wars+Season+1+04of10+Bullship+DVDRip+x264+AAC+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff87a69dc0b11da7c5f5e94896fa461d3bfd5f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,248,122,105,220,11,17,218,124,95,94,148,137,111,164,97,211,191,213,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
