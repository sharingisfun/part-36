Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and catalytic processes will be discussed in a unified and comprehensive approach. There will be extensive cross-referencing within all volumes. The use of catalysts in the nanoscale offers various advantages (increased efficiency and less byproducts), and these are discussed in this volume along with the various catalytic processes using nanoparticles. However, this is not without any risks and the safety aspects and effects on humans and the environment are still unknown. The present data as well as future needs are all part of this volume along with the economics involved.\n\nOffers in-depth coverage of all catalytic topics of current interest and outlines future challenges and research areasA clear and visual description of all parameters and conditions, enabling the reader to draw conclusions for a particular caseOutlines the catalytic processes applicable to energy generation and design of green processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064d9c1d4430fedc9abd67a20692038e16923f11","amp;dn":"New+and+Future+Developments+in+Catalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064d9c1d4430fedc9abd67a20692038e16923f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,77,156,29,68,48,254,220,154,189,103,162,6,146,3,142,22,146,63,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
