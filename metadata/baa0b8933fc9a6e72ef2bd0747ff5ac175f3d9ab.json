I found this one at the library a few weeks ago and wasn&amp;#039;t planning on uploading it at the time - I was just excited to find that the library had CDs. I encourage all of you to go to your local libraries and see if they&amp;#039;ve got some good music you can rip and then upload to share with all of us :)\n\nPink Mountaintops is a side project of Stephen McBeans (Black Mountain front man) and runs along the same vein as Black Mountain, though maybe a little more on the experimental side of things. It&amp;#039;s not the equal of Black Mountain, but if you like BM then you&amp;#039;ll probably enjoy hearing this, too.\n\nTrack list:\n1. &quot;Bad Boogie Ballin&amp;#039;&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:32\n2. &quot;Rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;roll Fantasy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:36\n3. &quot;I (Fuck) Mountains&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:42\n4. &quot;Can You Do That Dance?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:35\n5. &quot;Sweet &amp;#039;69&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:02\n6. &quot;Leslie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:21\n7. &quot;Tourist in Your Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:27\n8. &quot;Atmosphere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:53\n\nAlso, I&amp;#039;m now kicking myself for ever using the iTunes store to buy music when I was too impatient to wait for a CD to come in the mail... I bought the other Pink Mountain album, Axis of Evol, a while back and am wishing that I had it in lossless. If anyone&amp;#039;s got that album, please put up a lossless torrent for us! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa0b8933fc9a6e72ef2bd0747ff5ac175f3d9ab","amp;dn":"Pink+Mountaintops+-+S%2FT+-+slavetothesound+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa0b8933fc9a6e72ef2bd0747ff5ac175f3d9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,160,184,147,63,201,166,231,46,242,189,7,71,255,90,193,117,243,217,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
