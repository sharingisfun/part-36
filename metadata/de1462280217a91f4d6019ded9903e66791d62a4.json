Posthumus is an independent music group that produces cinematic style music. It is a form of classical that intertwines popular style drum rhythms with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean philosophy which states that &quot;music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements&quot;. The E.S. is an acronym for &quot;Experimental Sounds&quot; while Posthumus is a Dog Latin word that is meant to represent &quot;all things past&quot;.[1]\n\nThe group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. Their music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios, being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows. E.S. Posthumus have so far released three albums. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.S._Posthumus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.S._Posthumus&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeed. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tag/freesun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tag/freesun&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de1462280217a91f4d6019ded9903e66791d62a4","amp;dn":"E.S.+Posthumus+-+Cartographer+%282008%29+%5B320+Kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de1462280217a91f4d6019ded9903e66791d62a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,20,98,40,2,23,169,31,77,96,25,222,217,144,62,102,121,29,98,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
