Stefan challenges Esther Rantzen and Rebecca Wilcox to make rival chocolate-covered honeycomb bars, but whose will go in the basket and whose will go in the bin?\n\n2)  Just Add Water \nStefan Gates reveals the secrets of supermarket food by making his own from scratch. Does instant soup contain real tomatoes? How much seawater is needed to make sea salt? Stefan challenges Anton Du Beke and Jodie Prenger to make rival bottles of orange squash, but whose will go in the basket and whose will go in the bin?\n\n3)  All about Wheat \nWhy does dried spaghetti keep so long, and why do supermarket sandwiches stay soft in the fridge? Stefan challenges MasterChef's John Torode and Lisa Faulkner to make rival 'wheaty breakfast bricks' but whose will go in the basket and whose will go in the bin?\n\n4)  Frozen \nWhy are coffee granules frozen at the factory? Why must peas be frozen fast? Stefan challenges BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood and Chris Hollins to make rival multi-coloured ice lollies, but whose will go in the basket, and whose will go in the bin?\n\n5)  Ready Made \nWhy do some pizzas contain 'fake cheese', and how horrible is dog food? Stefan challenges The One Show regulars Lucy Siegle and Mike Dilger to make rival versions of ready-made custard, but whose will go in the basket and whose will go in the bin?\n\n6)  Sugar Rush \nDo energy drinks really work? Why is some honey runny? Stefan challenges Food Show hosts Simon Rimmer and Tim Lovejoy to make rival bags of sugar from sugar cane and sugar beet, but whose will go in the basket and whose will go in the bin?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/5356/foodfactoryseries3scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1558 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 29.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jun/26/food-factory-jimmy-doherty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jun/26/food-factory-jimmy-doherty&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeb39307a274bc866139cd6bdfc418eb95626b97","amp;dn":"BBC+Food+Factory+Series+3+4of6+Frozen+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeb39307a274bc866139cd6bdfc418eb95626b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,179,147,7,162,116,188,134,97,57,205,107,223,196,24,235,149,98,107,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
