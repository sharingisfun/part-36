Moody, dark and with frequent use of music and visuals.   This is a 20 year old tv broadcast rip of poor quality, which is unfortunate for a film of such stunning visual quality.  It does, however, have English subtitles, so if anyone knows of a better quality version around, perhaps they could be transferred.  I offer this for those fans of the director who would like to see it.\n\n\nThe movie is dedicated to Andrey Tarkovsky who supported Sokurov in the period of struggle for the film. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122591/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122591/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9561f66cc0adeb98d4e269e81e9eeb4814c70b","amp;dn":"Sokurov+-++Odinokiy+Golos+Cheloveka+AKA+The+Lonely+Voice+of+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9561f66cc0adeb98d4e269e81e9eeb4814c70b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,149,97,246,108,192,173,235,152,212,226,105,232,30,158,235,72,20,199,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
