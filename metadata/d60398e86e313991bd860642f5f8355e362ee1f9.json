M. Forster set against the backdrop of the British Raj and the Indian independence movement in the 1920s. It was selected as one of the 100 great works of English literature by the Modern Library and won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. Time magazine included the novel in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;.\n\nThe story revolves around four characters: Dr. Aziz, his British friend Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Adela Quested. During a trip to the Marabar Caves (Which is actually Barabar Caves of Bihar), Adela accuses Aziz of attempting to rape her. Aziz's trial, and its run-up and aftermath, bring out all the racial tensions and prejudices between indigenous Indians and the British colonists who rule India. In A Passage to India, Forster employs his first-hand knowledge of India.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Passage_to_India#Plot_summary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Passage_to_India#Plot_summary&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRead by Samuel West\nProduced by Di Speirs\nAbridged by Sally Marmion\n\n\nA Passage To India - 01 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 02 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 03 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 04 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 05 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 06 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 07 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 08 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 09 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 10 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 11 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 12 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 13 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 14 of 15 \nA Passage To India - 15 of 15 \n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 14mn\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d60398e86e313991bd860642f5f8355e362ee1f9","amp;dn":"A+Passage+To+India+-+AudioBook+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d60398e86e313991bd860642f5f8355e362ee1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,3,152,232,110,49,57,145,189,134,6,66,245,248,53,94,54,46,225,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
