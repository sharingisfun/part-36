This child of fading humanity was abandoned by his father after the pact with darkness went awry. He was later found by a merciful and sympathetic inventor who blessed his broken body with a stunning array of half-magical prosthetics. Now his arms, legs, ears, and 42 other miscellaneous appendages and organs have been replaced with mechanical devices like detachable hands that hide built-in swords and knees that open to reveal devastating cannons. You take command of this reformed champion samurai and venture across many ancient lands to vanquish 48 demons and lesser-demons, all inspired by Japanese mythology. Your quest is to reclaim your humanity and reap the rewards of vengeance.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
