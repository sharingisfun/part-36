A Few Seconds of Radiant Filmstrip follows him over the course of a single school year as he sets out in search of himself: losing old friends and gaining new ones, happening into his first kiss, writing plays and stories, dressing as Dolly Parton for Halloween, booby-trapping his lunch to deter a thief. With the same deep feeling and oddly dreamlike precision that are the hallmarks of his fiction, Brockmeier now explores the dream of his own past, recovering the person he used to be, the friends he had, the hopes he nurtured, the doubts he hid, the secrets he kept, the books he readÃ¢â‚¬â€everything that was once his life. He has written a singularly candid, daring, and open-hearted memoir that unfolds with the immediacy of a novel and richly recreates a particular time, place, and consciousness, one that every reader will recognize.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:441ba35f3cb9ce51af06af2ba36de1f8e8aa5e1f","amp;dn":"A+Few+Seconds+of+Radiant+Filmstrip-+A+Memoir+of+Seventh+Grade+by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"441ba35f3cb9ce51af06af2ba36de1f8e8aa5e1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,27,163,95,60,185,206,81,175,6,175,43,163,109,225,248,232,170,94,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
