Date of publication is 1970 by the R.A. Lister &amp; Co Ltd., Dursley, Gloucestershire, England. I know many owners of Listeroid engines from Asia and India have found this manual very helpful.\n\nImages are in .JPG format, and while not the greatest quality scans, they are still usable. And definitely better than not having any manual at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46155eecb822deb32f693c3d00d44c6f916892e9","amp;dn":"Lister+Diesel+Engine+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46155eecb822deb32f693c3d00d44c6f916892e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,21,94,236,184,34,222,179,47,105,60,61,0,212,76,111,145,104,146,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
