Full of irrefutable quotes from the mouths of the plotters and planners of the New World Order and the New Age Movement, Cuddy reveals the sinister origins and development of the New World Order from 1902 to 1992. What follows is a fast-reading story of money manipulation and political intrigue - exposing plans which have already cost Americans trillions of dollars and will cost trillions more. Revealed for the first time are the 4 powerful unelected men who secretly rule America. Through interlocking directorates, they control the debt and destiny of America - they elect and dictate to Presidents. This Network of Power is above the CFR, Trilateral Commission and even the almighty FED. Recommended for anyone who wants to know the true background of historical events. Find out how it all began and where it is leading to. 65 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78866515a07a09f1fe0886972c165cf1ba96b4a4","amp;dn":"Cuddy%26Goldsborough+-+Network+of+Power%26New+World+Order%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78866515a07a09f1fe0886972c165cf1ba96b4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,134,101,21,160,122,9,241,254,8,134,151,44,22,92,241,186,150,180,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
