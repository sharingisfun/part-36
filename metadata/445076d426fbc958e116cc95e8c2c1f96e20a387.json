As the nature of war has changed, who is the real enemy today? Is it the people at home watching TV? And is the journalist's job to normalise the unthinkable? The film contains shocking, never before seen footage from Iraq and Afghanistan and revealing interviews with former BBC reporter Rageh Omaar, former CBS anchor Dan Rather and Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks.\n\nITV Site1\nhttp://www.itv.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:445076d426fbc958e116cc95e8c2c1f96e20a387","amp;dn":"ITV+The+War+You+Don%5C%27t+See+1080p+HDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"445076d426fbc958e116cc95e8c2c1f96e20a387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,80,118,212,38,251,201,88,225,22,204,149,232,194,193,249,110,32,163,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
