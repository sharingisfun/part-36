Parabola aims to keep its package and management tools simple. The primary goal is to give the user complete control over their system with 100% Libre software. Parabola is listed by the Free Software Foundation as a fully free software distribution.\n\nDevelopment is focused on a balance of simplicity, elegance, code-correctness and bleeding edge free software.\n\nIts lightweight and simple design makes it easy to extend and mold into whatever kind of system you're building.\n\nYou can find us on #parabola or mailing list. \n\n(Source: https://wiki.parabolagnulinux.org/Main_Page)\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nI highly recommend the use of Parabola Linux.
