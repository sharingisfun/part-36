Surprisingly Fretblanket have transcended the Seattleisms most American-sounding foreign bands have opted for recently, and they head straight for America's breadbasket, the great Midwest. They take a hefty swing at Soul Asylum's pensive, hearty, and highly melodic angst ridden anthems, without blatantly nicking their moves. Vocalist/guitarist Will Copley's raspy croaking gives an edge to the music that some of the slick production has polished off and he adds subtle vocal hooks that make songs like &quot;Twisted&quot; attractive without being gaudy. It's good solid rock and roll, in spite of its sketchy origins.\n\nDescription from Amazon.com\n\n\n\nAs always... If you do like it PLEASE support the artist.
