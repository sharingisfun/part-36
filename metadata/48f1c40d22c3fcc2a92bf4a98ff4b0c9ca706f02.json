Kiyoko, along with her husband Shinji (Keiju Kobayashi), wants to open a coffee shop and so goes to Kenkichi to ask for a loan. Director Mikio Naruse never focuses on the duo's talk of money; as filmed, their entire relationship is a series of beginnings and endings with the middles cut out. It is at first purely a business association, though after Shinji (at the manipulative behest of his matchmaker mother) gives a majority of the loan to his deadbeat brother Zenichi, Kiyoko starts to think that her feelings for Kenkichi may be more then platonic. Following through on his setup, Naruse never lets either character nakedly confess their heart's desire. The closest they come is during a sequence, set against the backdrop of a torrential downpour, where Kenkichi utters the first few words of a thought that he will never finish. In other hands this scene might have played as masochistic repression, but Naruse allows the rainstorm to act as an expressive emotional outletÃ¢â‚¬â€nature thus concludes what Kenkichi cannot.\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : A.Wifes.Heart.1956.Mikio.Naruse.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.45 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 133 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nBit rate                         : 1 996 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 472 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.276\nStream size                      : 1.36 GiB (94%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 89.2 MiB (6%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48f1c40d22c3fcc2a92bf4a98ff4b0c9ca706f02","amp;dn":"A+Wife%27s+Heart+AKA+Tsuma+no+Kokoro+%28Mikio+Naruse%2C+1956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48f1c40d22c3fcc2a92bf4a98ff4b0c9ca706f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,241,196,13,34,195,252,194,169,43,244,169,143,244,176,201,202,112,111,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
