He was right, for there attention to details on the backing vocals and music is second to none and the mass swap out began.   Loads of time and cash later the collection of over 10,000 tracks are mostly all Sound Choice.   I do have to look else where for chart hits outside of North America where Sound choice fall down a little.\n\nThanks again to the original seed of the 3000 torrent, for whom I owe this series for I very much doubt if I could be bothered to re rip all my Karaoke CD's for this lot.\n\nThanks to the authors of two low cost but very good items of shareware...\n\n1.   Windsome file renamer        &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.filerenamer.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.filerenamer.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n2.

If you still use physical media and official Karaoke hardware then check out the original seed for that is still in the Sound Choice format and tags.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the series and your PC collection looks all the better now for my hard work.    \n\nTexas - In Our Lifetime [Karaoke] (4:03)\nTexas - Say What You Want [Karaoke] (3:57)\nThird Eye Blind - 10 Days Late [Karaoke] (3:05)\nThird Eye Blind - Anything [Karaoke] (1:53)\nThird Eye Blind - Deep Inside Of You [Karaoke] (4:05)\nThird Eye Blind - How's It Going To Be [Karaoke] (4:03)\nThird Eye Blind - Jumper [Karaoke] (4:34)\nThird Eye Blind - Never Let You Go [Karaoke] (3:56)\nThird Eye Blind - Semi-Charmed Life [Karaoke] (3:37)\nThompson, Cyndi - If You Could Only See [Karaoke] (3:05)  OOPS missed this one!!!\nThrasher Shiver - Be Honest [Karaoke] (3:09)\nThrasher Shiver - Between The Stones And Jones [Karaoke] (2:59)\nThree Days Grace - Home [Karaoke] (4:17)\nThree Days Grace - I Hate Everything About You [Karaoke] (3:47)\nThree Days Grace - Just Like You [Karaoke] (3:04)\nTI - U Don't Know Me [Karaoke] (4:01)\nTI Destiny's Child &amp; Lil' Wayne - Soldier [Karaoke] (5:22)\nTim Rushlow - Crazy Life [Karaoke] (4:03)\nTim Rushlow - She Misses Him [Karaoke] (3:43)\nTim Rushlow - When You Love Me [Karaoke] (3:55)\nTim Wilson - Ballad Of John Rocker [Karaoke] (1:38)\nTina Turner - Open Arms [Karaoke] (3:56)\nTina Turner - Whatever You Need [Karaoke] (4:21)\nTina Turner - When The Heartache Is Over [Karaoke] (3:45)\nTLC - Damaged [Karaoke] (4:02)\nTLC - Dear Lie [Karaoke] (4:40)\nTLC - Girl Talk [Karaoke] (3:33)\nTLC - No Scrubs [Karaoke] (3:42)\nTLC - Silly Ho [Karaoke] (4:11)\nTLC - Unpretty [Karaoke] (5:00)\nToad The Wet Sprocket - Come Down [Karaoke] (2:58)\nTommy Shane Steiner  &amp; Bridgette Wilson Sampras - What We're Gonna Do About It [Karaoke] (4:01)\nTommy Shane Steiner - Tell Me Where It Hurts [Karaoke] (4:08)\nTommy Shane Steiner - What If She's An Angel [Karaoke] (3:25)\nToni Braxton - He Wasn't Man Enough [Karaoke] (4:20)\nToni Braxton - I Don't Want To [Karaoke] (4:38)\nToni Braxton - I Love Me Some Him [Karaoke] (5:22)\nToni Braxton - Just Be A Man About It [Karaoke] (4:17)\nToni Braxton - Spanish Guitar [Karaoke] (4:06)\nToni Braxton &amp; Kenny G - How Could An Angel Break My Heart [Karaoke] (4:16)\nTonic - If You Could Only See Me Now [Karaoke] (4:06)\nTonic - Knock Down Walls [Karaoke] (3:42)\nTonic - Mean To Me [Karaoke] (4:13)\nTonic - Open Up Your Eyes [Karaoke] (3:16)\nTonic - Sugar [Karaoke] (3:23)\nTonic - Take Me As I Am [Karaoke] (3:28)\nTonic - You Wanted More [Karaoke] (3:46)\nTony Bennett &amp; KD Lang - What A Wonderful World [Karaoke] (3:17)\nTony Rich Project - Leavin' [Karaoke] (3:50)\nTony Toni Tone - Let's Get Down [Karaoke] (3:49)\nTony Toni Tone - Thinking Of You [Karaoke] (3:34)\nTool - Schism [Karaoke] (6:41)\nTori Amos - Silent All These Years [Karaoke] (4:02)\nTori Amos - Spark [Karaoke] (4:05)\nToya - I Do!
