Great tunes here,\nin tradition of preceeding AC/DC albums.\nWith &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; you get a good example of how AC/DC kept it all real. They didn't go with what was current, they didn't buy into the hype of fashion and publicity.\nThey just had a will to rock, and the will, and geuis to do so.\nAlthough not as good as other 80's albums, (Black...For Those...Switch...) it is better than &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; (although that's a pretty good album.) Out of all 10 songs, the best would be &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, &quot;That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll&quot;, \n&quot;Some Sin For Nuthin'&quot;, &quot;Ruff Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Meanstreak&quot;.\n&quot;Meanstreak&quot; has an undeniable funk, and you can't help but get something either bobbing or tapping in time to it's beat.\n&quot;Some Sin...&quot; is a slower, burning number, with a good hook, and classic rock feel, plus a dash of R&amp;B.\n&quot;Heatseeker&quot;, one of the live show staples, just plain rocks out.\nWith the twelve-bar blues structure, and good...everything.\n&quot;That's The Way...&quot; is yet again, a fast paced rocker, with kick and bite to it, paying tribute to the good old days of rock.\n(An add for Chevy cars used a clip of this song which mentions a Chevy in a magazine, once.)\n&quot;Ruff Stuff&quot; is a pure, all-out hook-fest.(as described in the booklet). With a good melodic tint to it, and an equally melodic hooky riff, this song is one of their best, and has a somewhat &quot;different&quot; sound for AC/DC.\nAnd the others are good, too. If you can only buy two albums from the new set of re-masters, get this, and my personal favorite, &quot;Flick Of The Switch&quot;. You'll go home happy, and have these songs stuck in your head for quite a while (but that's a good thing, isn't it...) \n\nby Chris Pollman\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Heatseeker.wma                                         \n02 - That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll.wma                 \n03 - Mean Streak.wma                                        \n04 - Go Zone.wma                                            \n05 - Kissin' Dynamite.wma                                   \n06 - Nick Of Time.wma                                       \n07 - Some Sin For Nuthin'.wma                               \n08 - Ruff Stuff.wma                                         \n09 - Two's Up.wma                                           \n10 - This Means War.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5250b4f6f38a9a32e15e27d166c47e51c942376","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Blow+Up+Your+Video+%281988%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5250b4f6f38a9a32e15e27d166c47e51c942376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,37,11,79,111,56,169,163,46,21,226,125,22,108,71,229,28,148,35,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
