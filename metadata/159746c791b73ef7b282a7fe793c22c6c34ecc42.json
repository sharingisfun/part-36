I'll leave it to the DMB crew to say it best (see below).\nRest in peace, Roi. We all love and will miss you.\n\nAs we sat this afternoon contemplating the loss of our brother, we wondered how we \ncould possibly do a show today. Dave put it into perspective stating, &quot;There's no place I'd rather be than here with you guys right now.&quot; We cherish special memories of our lost friend. Tonight, Dave told a story about LeRoi at a bar in Virginia where the cash register was near the stage and LeRoi leaned on the register because &quot;standing had become a chore&quot;.\n \nRoi proceeded to play the most beautiful version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Dave said, &quot;that was the day I fell in love with him. And I'm still in love with him.&quot; It's safe to say we all were in love with him. &quot;It's always easier to leave, than to be left.&quot; -DM\n\nThe DMB Crew\nWednesday, August 20\n12:27 AM PDT\n\n\nNever pay for or sell live recordings. \n\nCompiled on 8.20.08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:159746c791b73ef7b282a7fe793c22c6c34ecc42","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+Live+-+8%2F19%2F2008+%28FLAC%29+-+RIP+Leroi+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"159746c791b73ef7b282a7fe793c22c6c34ecc42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,151,70,199,145,183,62,247,178,130,167,254,121,60,34,198,195,78,204,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
