A strange scent \nhangs faintly in the air, and the young couple cannot shake the sense of \nsomething wrong.\n\nAs hours pass and the rain continues to fall, Molly and Neil listen to the \ndisturbing news of extreme weather phenomena across the globe. Before \nevening, their small California mountain town loses television and radio \nreception. Then telephone and the internet are gone. With the ceaseless rain \nnow comes an obscuring fog that transforms the once-friendly village into a \nghostly labyrinth. By nightfall the Sloans have gathered with some of their \nneighbors to deal with community damage...but also because they feel the \nneed to band together against some unknown threat, some enemy they \ncannot identify or even imagine.\n\nIn the night, strange noises arise, and at a distance, in the rain and the mist, \nmysterious lights are seen drifting among the trees. Soon Molly, Neil, and \ntheir small band of friends will be forced to draw on reserves of strength, \ncourage, and humanity they never knew they had. For within the misty gloom \nthey will encounter something that reveals in a terrifying instant what is \nhappening to their world?something this is hunting them with ruthless \nefficiency.\n\nEpic in scope, searingly intimate and immediate in perspective, The Taking is \nan adventure story like no other, a relentless roller-coaster read that brings \napocalypse to Main Street and showcases the talents of one of our most \noriginal and mesmerizing novelists at the pinnacle of his powers.\n\n----\n\nDean Koontz, the author of many #1 New York Times bestsellers, lives with \nhis wife, Gerda, and their dog, Trixie, in southern California.\n\n----\n\nAri Meyers starred as Emma McArdle on the ground-breaking television series \nKate and Allie. Her film credits include Author! Author! with Al Pacino, Dutch, \nand How to Make An American Quilt.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b5321167df484818350dcfe85a6d40b1dc8febf","amp;dn":"Dean+Koontz+-+The+Taking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b5321167df484818350dcfe85a6d40b1dc8febf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,83,33,22,125,244,132,129,131,80,220,254,133,166,212,11,29,200,254,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
