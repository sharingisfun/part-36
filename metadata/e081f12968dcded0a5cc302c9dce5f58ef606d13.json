Local experts and everyday folks lead host Brian Unger to insights about some of America's most baffling questions. How are flying fish threatening to re-draw the shape of Illinois? What does the use of cell phones by Pennsylvania's Amish have to do with the shape of their state? How is the phrase sold down the river linked to the shape of what might be the 51st state? Why did the invention of air conditioning change how America picks its Presidents? Unger uncovers the answers, hidden in the map. This is no textbook-style documentary series, each episode finds quirky and fun facts to inform and educate, and the comedic style will appeal perfectly to both older and younger consumers, from students to history buffs. Host Brian Unger is well known for his irreverent YouTube online news programme The Young Turks which is the biggest show of its type in the World.\n\n\n\n\n4)  State of Rebellion \nHow did the most rebellious states took shape? How did they earn their outsized features and outspoken reputations? For instance, why does Montana looks like it took a bite out of Idaho? Why wasn't Texas broken up into five states? And why exactly do we have not one but two Carolinas?\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2998/howthestatesgottheirshaj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2998/howthestatesgottheirshaj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/668/howthestatesgottheirshab.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/668/howthestatesgottheirshab.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/2117/howthestatesgottheirshaz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/2117/howthestatesgottheirshaz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6051/howthestatesgottheirsha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bdf5d4dad5fdf18e938c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2004 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AC3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AVR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 40mins\n * Frame rate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 587 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_States_Got_Their_Shapes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_States_Got_Their_Shapes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e081f12968dcded0a5cc302c9dce5f58ef606d13","amp;dn":"History+Ch+How+the+States+Got+Their+Shapes+Series+1+04of10+State","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e081f12968dcded0a5cc302c9dce5f58ef606d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,129,241,41,104,220,222,208,165,204,48,44,157,206,95,88,239,96,109,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
