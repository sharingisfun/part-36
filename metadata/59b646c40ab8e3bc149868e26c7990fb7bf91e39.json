I captured it from analog cable (in Asia) and the video quality is mediocre. I tried new conversion software on this one. I transcoded away from MS Media Center format using Bigasoft WTV converter. Then I edited out the commercials using Camtasia  7.1.  Then I cropped and tried to improve video quality/file size with Handbrake.\n\nThe result is good quality and smaller file size than my other uploads. This is the first hour of a 2 hour program. I'll do part 2 the next time History Channel airs this interesting documentary.
