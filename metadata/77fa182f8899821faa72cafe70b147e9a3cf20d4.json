Activities are rich in mathematical content, formats, contextual information, and representation formats, which offer wonderful teaching ideas for pre-service teachers. Each of the activities is accompanied with objects (and other components) and the objective is stated in terms of students' terminal observable behavior indicators. The most appealing part of this book is its approach to explaining how to teach mathematics to pre-service teachers, and its well-balanced focus on both conceptual and procedural aspects of teaching and learning mathematics.\n\nBrief Contents\nPART ONE Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Guiding Elementary Mathematics with Standards 1\n1 Elementary Mathematics for the 21st Century 3\n2 Defining a Comprehensive Mathematics Curriculum 11\n3 Mathematics for Every Child 27\n4 Learning Mathematics 47\n5 Organizing Effective Instruction 57\n6 The Role of Technology in the Mathematics Classroom 79\n7 Integrating Assessment 93\n\nPART TWO Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Mathematical Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving 111\n8 Developing Problem-Solving Strategies 113\n9 Developing Concepts of Number 137\n10 Extending Number Concepts and Number Systems 161\n11 Developing Number Operations with Whole Numbers 187\n12 Extending Computational Fluency with Larger Numbers 229\n13 Developing Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 253\n14 Extending Understanding of Common and Decimal Fractions 287\n15 Developing Aspects of Proportional Reasoning: Ratio, Proportion, and Percent 333\n16 Thinking Algebraically 357\n17 Developing Geometric Concepts and Systems 389\n18 Developing and Extending Measurement Concepts 437\n19 Understanding and Representing Concepts of Data 489\n20 Investigating Probability 523\nAppendix A NCTM Table of Standards and Expectations 545\nAppendix B Black-Line Masters 557","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77fa182f8899821faa72cafe70b147e9a3cf20d4","amp;dn":"Guiding+Children%27s+Learning+of+Mathematics+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77fa182f8899821faa72cafe70b147e9a3cf20d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,250,24,47,136,153,130,31,170,114,202,254,112,177,71,233,163,207,32,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
