Very clear, recorded much close to the \r\nstage (very likely near the dead center), and well positioned, \r\nhas great atmosphere without any distortion. \r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01 Introduction\r\n02 Immigrant Song\r\n03 Heartbreaker\r\n04 Dazed and Confused\r\n05 Bring it on Home\r\n06 That's the Way\r\n07 Bron-Yr-Aur\r\n08 Since I've Been Loving You\r\n09 Organ Improvisation\r\n10 Thank You\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n01 What Is and What Should Never Be\r\n02 Moby Dick\r\n03 Whole Lotta Love\r\n04 Communication Breakdown\r\n05 Out On the Tiles\r\n06 Blueberry Hill\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nExceptional! This show captures Zeppelin at their fun and most \r\nenergetic best. A great late DJ JJ Jackson made his appearance \r\ntonight introducing the band on stage. &quot;Good evening! Nice to \r\nbe back. This is gotta be about the sixth time&quot; stated Plant \r\nafter storming Immigrant Song/Heartbreaker medley. A kicking \r\nshow with a very Hendrix-inspired Dazed And Confused and the \r\nfirst to last known recording of Out On The Tiles live, as a \r\nrare encore, as well as the surprise Blueberry Hill encore! \r\nThat's The Way was introcued to the audience with much \r\nappreciation so Plant commented that: &quot;It gives us great \r\npleasure to hear that. We've had a bit of abuse in the Midwest, \r\nevery time you sit on a chair and pick up a mandolin.&quot; A rowdy \r\naudience throwed few firecrackers onstage before the first encore \r\nso Plant asked: &quot;Who throw that firecracker? You ought to be locked up!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec52322c6d4c20287f351df3aef160446640f498","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1970.09.04+Inglewood%2C+LA+Forum+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec52322c6d4c20287f351df3aef160446640f498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,82,50,44,109,76,32,40,127,53,29,243,174,241,96,68,102,64,244,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
