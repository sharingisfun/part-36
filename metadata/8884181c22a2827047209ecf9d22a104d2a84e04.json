Unlike other reviews, the book embeds required information into compelling, unfolding case studies-studies that evolve over time-in order to promote active learning and facilitate knowledge retention.\n\nThese unfolding case studies are of particular value because they closely mimic real-life situations in nursing and provide situational mental models that assist students with problem-solving and critical thinking techniques. The unfolding case study method also assists in the development of skills that are important for NCLEX-RN success in assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation of patient care. All content areas required for NCLEX-RN success-safe and effective care, health promotion, physiological and psychological integrity--are interwoven in an enjoyable format that dispels the drudgery of straightforward memorization. A variety of NCLEX-style question formats are used throughout the book to help students assess their own learning. Additionally, eResource links to additional information are included throughout the book.\n\nKey Features:\nUses unique unfolding case study method to present medical-surgical concepts\nPromotes active learning and knowledge retention\nDevelops problem-solving and critical thinking skills\nProvides all of types of NCLEX-style questions for exam preparation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8884181c22a2827047209ecf9d22a104d2a84e04","amp;dn":"Medical-Surgical+Nursing+Test+Success+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8884181c22a2827047209ecf9d22a104d2a84e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,132,24,28,34,162,130,112,71,32,158,207,157,34,161,4,210,168,78,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
