One of the most famous disappearances occurred in December 1945, when Flight 19, consisting of five US Navy bombers, vanished while on a training exercise.\n\nOne explanation for the mysterious disappearance of entire ships could be large pockets of gas which are common on the sea bed in the area. When the gas rises to the surface they dissolve in the water, decreasing the buoyancy of ships and causing them to sink.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2149d41f45dcb190848b1451e3ccd337c8192bf6","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+%3A+Bermuda+Triangle+Beneath+the+Waves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2149d41f45dcb190848b1451e3ccd337c8192bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,73,212,31,69,220,177,144,132,139,20,81,227,204,211,55,200,25,43,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
