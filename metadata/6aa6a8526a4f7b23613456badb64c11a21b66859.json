How is this possible? Because Exotic Matter was founded by the people who used to write those powerful in-house fluid tools.\n\nDespite being a relatively new product, Naiad has already been used to produce the 3D fluid animations in several motion-pictures, some of which are listed below:\n\nAvatar (Weta Digital)\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (Framestore London)\nNarnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Framestore London)\nGulliverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Travels (Weta Digital)\nX-Men: First Class (Weta Digital)\nFinal Destination 5 (Prime Focus)\nThe A-Team (Weta Digital)\nShark Night 3D (Reliant MediaWorks/Crater Studios/Shadow VFX)\nNaiad is also being used frequently in TV series and commercials.\n\n \n\nHome Site Link :Ã¢â‚¬â€œ http://www.exoticmatter.com/naiad-ds-overview/\n\n\n\nCopypasta from: http://cgpersia.com/2012/01/exotic-matter-naiad-0-6-0-69-win-x64-20893.html#ixzz2Lf5V5dhS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa6a8526a4f7b23613456badb64c11a21b66859","amp;dn":"Exotic+Matter+Naiad+0.6.1.43+%2F+WIN+64bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa6a8526a4f7b23613456badb64c11a21b66859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,166,168,82,106,79,123,35,97,52,86,186,219,100,193,26,33,182,104,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
