It was released on August 24, 2010 via Capitol Nashville. &quot;Little White Church,&quot; which was released in March 2010 as the album's lead-off single, has since become a Top 10 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nThe album's title track was released as a digital single on July 27, 2010 to begin an iTunes countdown to the album release on August 24, 2010. Three further digital singles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Kiss Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Why, Oh Why,&quot; and &quot;All the Way Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were released weekly leading up until the album release. &quot;Little White Church&quot; is the first release to radio, having reached Top 10 on the Hot Country Songs charts. &quot;Rain on a Tin Roof,&quot; written by Chris Stapleton and Trent Willmon, previously appeared on Julie Roberts's 2004 self-titled debut album. The album's second single, &quot;Kiss Goodbye,&quot; was released to radio in October 2010.\n\nThe Reason Why debuted at #5 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and became their first #1 record on the U.S. Billboard Country Albums charts, with first week sales of 41,939. As of November 20, 2010, the album has sold 121,026 copies in the U.S.\n\nThe Reason Why received primarily positive reviews from music critics. Giving it four stars out of five, Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine thought that it was the band's most consistent album, praising the vocal harmonies as well as the cuts on which Karen Fairchild sang lead. He also thought that the band's sound was less derivative of Fleetwood Mac on this album than on previous works. Jessica Phillips of Country Weekly rated it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that the group had &quot;renewed energy&quot; on it, also highlighting Fairchild's lead vocals. Both Keefe and Phillips compared &quot;Little White Church&quot; favorably to Little Big Town's 2005 single &quot;Boondocks.&quot; Thom Jurek of Allmusic also thought that the album showed a growth in sound over the band's two albums for Equity Music Group, giving it four stars out of five. Jim Malec of American Twang thought the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal arrangements were &quot;overbearing and gimmicky,&quot; claiming that that the album often &quot;sounds like the soundtrack to a Broadway musical.&quot; However, he complimented the group member's individual voices, in particular Karen Fairchild's.\n\nLittle Big Town is an American country music vocal group. Founded in 1998, the group has comprised the same four members since its inception: Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman, Jimi Westbrook, and Phillip Sweet. The quartet's musical style relies heavily on four-part vocal harmonies, with all four members alternating as lead singers. Westbrook and Sweet also play rhythm guitar.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b29f941cdb90cf3df15313082322bfa80f20a14","amp;dn":"Little+Big+Town+-+Kiss+Goodbye+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b29f941cdb90cf3df15313082322bfa80f20a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,41,249,65,205,185,12,243,223,21,49,48,130,50,43,250,128,242,10,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
