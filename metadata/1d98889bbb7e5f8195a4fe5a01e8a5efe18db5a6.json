Twenty years ago, the most famous, lifelike robot in the world was engulfed in scandal, arrested, and deactivated. Since then, an anti-robot movement has developed, while body modification is in and prosthetic limbs have become hot, black-market items. Stories like these are the stock-in-trade of gossip columnist Sergio Bauntin, whose startling revelations earn him the constant scrutiny of both the mob and the city's mysterious investigators, the Truth Takers. When Sergio catches wind of sightings of the long-missing robot celebrity CTZ-RX, all of these interests will collide in violence and intrigue. It's sci-fi adventure with beautiful women by Los Bros. Hernandez! Mario Hernandez (W) and Gilbert Hernandez\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d98889bbb7e5f8195a4fe5a01e8a5efe18db5a6","amp;dn":"Citizen+Rex+%234+%28of+6%29+-+GC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d98889bbb7e5f8195a4fe5a01e8a5efe18db5a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,152,136,155,187,126,95,129,149,164,254,90,1,232,165,239,225,141,181,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
