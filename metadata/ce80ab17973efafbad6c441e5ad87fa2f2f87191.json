Each 6-issue run has featured a different artist, beginning with Ted Naifeh, followed by Jon Gebbia, Breehn Burns, Harley Sparx  and currently Vincent Batignole.  The series functions both as a social satire on real-life Gothic subculture and as a supernatural fantasy.\n\nThe last issue was #28.  Serena Valentino stated that she intended to end the individual issue release of the series, in favour of releasing a series of complete graphic novels at an undisclosed time.  Serena, and Gloomcookie's current artist Vincent Batignole, have chosen to focus their efforts on a new comic project instead, titled Enchanted.\n\n\nReleased on &lt;a href=&quot; http://ComicPirates.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ComicPirates.info&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce80ab17973efafbad6c441e5ad87fa2f2f87191","amp;dn":"Gloomcookie+%28SLG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce80ab17973efafbad6c441e5ad87fa2f2f87191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,128,171,23,151,62,250,251,173,108,68,30,90,216,127,162,242,248,113,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
