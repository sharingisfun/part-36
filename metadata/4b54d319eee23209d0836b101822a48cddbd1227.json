Actuator does not require user intervention, the entire activation process takes place in the background, just run the activator and a couple of minutes to check the activation status of Windows and / or Office.\n\nFeatures:\n- Universal (Activates Windows Vista/7/8 Pro/Enterprise/N/VL and Office 2010/2013 Retail/VL.)\n- Does not require user intervention (enough to run the activator).\n- Simultaneous activation immediately and Windows, and Office.\n\nWith KMSpico can:\nActivate: Windows Vista/7/8  \nOffice 2010/2013 \nWindows Server 2008/2008R2/2012\n\n- Requirements:\n- Requirements: .NET 4.0 or Windows 8.\n- Activates Windows Vista/7/8 and Office 2010/2013.\n- Windows Server 2008/2008R2/2012\n\nInstruction:\n1. Run KMSpico.exe or RunTrigger.cmd\n2. Done..\n\nBased off of Microsoft Toolkit - Official KMS Solution for Microsoft Products 2.4.1.\n\nChange Log\nv 7.0\n- Redesigned and Recoded.\n- Removed funtions with slmgr.vbs and ospp.vbs.\n- Implemented 2 diferent kms emulators. If one fail the other maybe not.\n- Fixed bug in W7.\n- Add Support for W8.1\n- Convertion from Retail to VL changed (faster).\n- Now KMSELDI, AutoPico, Service_KMS do the same process for activation.\n- Add /silent command line to AutoPico.\n- Improved log files.\n\nNote:\n- If you install a Office Retail Version after the installation of KMSpico, then run again\nthe shortcut KMSpico to make the conversion, because the Service installed only activate VL.\n\nHow This Program Works:\n1. Run KMSELDI.exe\n1.1. Check Products Installed.\n1.2. Convert Retail to VL if it is necessary.\n1.3. If it found a non-permanent product it will converted. (hacktivators based in modified dll's ARE NOT PERMANENT) (MAK or OEM keys are the only ones PERMANENT)\n1.4. Create a random service kms emulator in memory.\n1.5. Activate for 180 days all VL products installed against the emulator.\n1.6. Close emulator and KMSELDI.\n2. Install Service KMSELDI\n2.1. Every windows start or every 24 hours the service reactivate for 180 days (reset the count) with a random kms emulator.\n2.2. Close emulator.\n3. KMSELDI + Service KMSELDI = &quot;permanent&quot;.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Disable Microsoft Security Updates.\n- Make exceptions to Directory %ProgramFiles%KMSpico in Antivirus.\nIn case you want do everything manually, check the *.cmd scripts inside; they work without .NET Framework 4.0.\n\n\nName: KMSpico_v7.rar\nSize: 2.83 MB\nCRC32: 15B4199D\nMD5: 7DD15B7CAF36BB64A13FCB3A930B59C3\nSHA-1: 48946A75F7F20BED924752DB38C022AC888AD465","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b54d319eee23209d0836b101822a48cddbd1227","amp;dn":"KMSpico+v7+Windows+8+Activator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b54d319eee23209d0836b101822a48cddbd1227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,84,211,25,238,226,50,9,208,131,107,16,24,34,164,140,221,189,18,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
