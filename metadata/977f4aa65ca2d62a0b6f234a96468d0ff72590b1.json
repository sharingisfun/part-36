The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus came\nright out of the gate with their debut full-length ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Lonely Road.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ It was built\nupon the hype of their rather famous debut and solid fan base that has stayed\nwith them while all the drama dropped from label wrestling.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Lonely RoadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s newest and 2nd full-length release. And this is no\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´sophomore jinxÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ for sure. The band has upped the ante from its previous output\nand produced an album that not only continues to blur the lines of different\nstyles of aggressive rock but also has a surprise at every corner.\n\nIt would seem that the band would leave off where their last album did, but this\nisnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t the case if you could imagine this record has everything you could ask for\nfrom sugar filled hooks to heart melting choruses. It may be hard to believe but\nthink A Change Of Pace (with old singer) meets Boys Like Girls or Anberlin. It\nhas that rock feel that those bands unleash but then has vocals that sound\ninsanely just like A Change Of Pace or My American Heart do. That may sound like\na lot of sound meshing but trust me the final outcome is incredible.\n\nOverall, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Lonely RoadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is a strong second outing for The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.\nThe only issue some casual listeners may find is the frenetic change in styles\nwith each song. It is a blend of all things punk, classic rock, and pop and this\nmay be too much for their fragile and virgin ears. But only them, great return\nfrom a band that is destined for great things with the right push! ~ Staff\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977f4aa65ca2d62a0b6f234a96468d0ff72590b1","amp;dn":"The_Red_Jumpsuit_Apparatus-Lonely_Road-2009-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977f4aa65ca2d62a0b6f234a96468d0ff72590b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,127,74,166,92,162,214,42,11,111,35,74,150,70,141,15,247,37,144,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
