Version 5 gives you more brilliant results in less time and with less effort.\nHighlights\n\nStep-by-step project assistant\n2D, 3D and cross-section views\nSmart input and construction aids\nIntegrated roof, staircase and environment builders\nRealistic light and shadow simulation\nExtensive object catalog\n\nDo-it-yourself planning and building\n\nAre you planning to build a house? Do you intend to redecorate a room or garden? Become your own architect and plan and design on your very own PC - Ashampoo 3D Architecture 5 makes it possible.\n\nEasier and more intuitive with ribbons\n\nYou no longer have to navigate through multiple unrelated toolbars with tiny icons. Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5 groups all features logically and thematically as tabbed toolbars (ribbon) with meaningful labels. And the new quick-access toolbar hosts all recently used features to save you time and nerves. Naturally, you can always go back to the classic toolbar view, if required.\n\nFaster and future-proof with native 64-bit support\n\nThe new 64-bit version gives you access to all of the available main memory in your PC. This means more space for graphics and complex calculations on systems with more than 3GB of RAM and consequently quicker access times for smoother workflows. Don't know whether you own a 64-bit system? Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5 automatically selects the version ideal for your system during installation.\n\nMore beautiful and expressive with custom fill patterns and 3D texture displays in 2D\n\nIn previous versions of 3D CAD Architecture, fill patterns were entirely based on drawing routines provided by Windows. With Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5, this limitation is now gone. Create your own patterns from lines, circles, curves etc. and use them in your projects. We have already added more than 30 new patterns such as reinforced concrete, bricks or parquet flooring. Now, you can also apply the many 3D textures in 2D and make your rooms look even more realistic. Of course, texture rotating and scaling is also possible in 2D views.\n\nAs real as it gets with realistic light and shadow simulation\n\nHow does your house look at night? In direct sunlight? At night? Use the integrated light and shadow simulation to find it out. Get a real-life picture of your building and also determine whether you've placed those solar elements in their ideal spots.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nOperating System:\nWin XP SP3, Win Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 10\n\nSoftware:\nMicrosoft .Net 4.0 Framework\nVisual Studio 2012 Redistributables\n\nComputer:\n\nProcessor:\n\n1,8 GHz Single Core Processor or higher\n\nMulti-core processor recommended for optimized rendering\n\nHarddisk space:\n\n1,6 GB for installation\n\nMemory:\n4 GB or more\n\nGraphic Card:\nMin. screen resolution 1024 x 768 with true color support\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\no1 - Unpack the release into a directory of your choice.\no2 - Run the installer and install it.\no3 - Copy the files from /crack into the installation directory.\no4 - Have a go with this unlimited trial, but buy it if you will use it.\no5 - As always, make sure to have a firewall to block outbound connections","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a49767821c4a50e809d7d835381a8c8cb1e5ce7","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+3D+CAD+Architecture+5.v5.5.0.02.1+MultiLang+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a49767821c4a50e809d7d835381a8c8cb1e5ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,73,118,120,33,196,165,14,128,157,125,131,83,129,168,200,203,30,92,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
