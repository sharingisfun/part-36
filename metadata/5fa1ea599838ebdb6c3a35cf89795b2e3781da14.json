The name \nof the album is derived from a line from the album's song &quot;Queen of Hollywood&quot;.\n\n    &quot;And her friends they talk on corners, they could never comprehend&quot;\n\nAfter its release, songs from this album were to dominate their live set for a long time \nto come and through the biggest growth period of the band's career. During this album's \nlong reign, they worked solidly with very little time off and gained a lot of exposure \nwith TV appearances and tours. Their next studio album took nearly 3 years to materialise. \nIn between was a live 'unplugged' album which introduced only a handful of new songs. \nHence their continuing reliance on existing material, some of which became subject to \nrearranging or remixing along the way.\n\n\n\n  01.
