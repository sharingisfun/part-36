They have over two million driver files in their database, and the software can check as often as you would like for new drivers. Driver Navigator answers their emails quickly, and this PC driver update software is easy to use even if you know nothing about your drivers. These are just some of the reasons Driver Navigator is our TopTenREVIEWS Bronze Award winner.\n\nThe only features we found missing were backup and restoration tools, so you have to save your driver versions on your own if you choose to use this software. Windows 7 does have a tool for rolling back to a previous driver version that can be used in conjunction with this updater software.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c10ef8dd09ce8a5644bd67e214f634739d4595e0","amp;dn":"drivernavigator3.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c10ef8dd09ce8a5644bd67e214f634739d4595e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,14,248,221,9,206,138,86,68,189,103,226,20,246,52,115,157,69,149,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
