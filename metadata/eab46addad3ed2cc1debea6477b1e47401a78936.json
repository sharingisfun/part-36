Their biggest mistake was letting him out!\n\nIn order to improve his standing with Black voters, a White Senator starts a campaign for the CIA to recruit Black agents. However, all are graded on a curve and doomed to fail, save for a soft-spoken veteran named Dan Freeman. After grueling training in guerrilla warfare, clandestine operations and unarmed combat, he is assigned a meager job as the CIA&amp;#039;s token Black employee. After five years of racist and stereotyped treatment by his superiors, he quietly resigns to return to his native Chicago to work for a social services agency...by day. By night, he trains a street gang to be the vanguard in an upcoming race war, using all that the CIA has taught him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab46addad3ed2cc1debea6477b1e47401a78936","amp;dn":"The+Spook+Who+Sat+By+The+Door","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab46addad3ed2cc1debea6477b1e47401a78936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,180,106,221,173,62,210,204,29,235,234,100,119,177,228,116,1,167,137,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
