In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Data Driven DesignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harris examines the shift from top-down design models to consumer-based methods that ask what users want and need. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Data Driven DesignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ covers user experience (UX) design in every phase, from initial thoughts, through prototypes, user feedback, online iterations, and finally, successful products. He shows how UX fits into the history of digital design, helping readers understand how we got here. From there he points the way to a future where the vast potentials of user experience promise to open up new worlds of possibility.\n\nComprehensive, concise and entertaining, this is the best introduction a reader can get to a fast-changing field. Designers, their clients, and anyone else with an interest in how design happens, should read this timely book.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec55d776854e7f6d6d8d065a6f32bac98e6de2b9","amp;dn":"Data+Driven+Design+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec55d776854e7f6d6d8d065a6f32bac98e6de2b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,85,215,118,133,78,127,109,109,141,6,90,111,50,186,201,142,109,226,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
