Composed in just four years between 1859 and 1863 on an unwieldy libretto by Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein, Christus may have been intended as Liszt's answer to Handel's Messiah, and at least in length -- three hours -- it is certainly a comparable effort. Christus, like nearly all of Liszt's music that does not involve the piano, has never caught on in any measure comparable to the works of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Brahms, or Handel mentioned above. Nevertheless, Christus is occasionally revived, and it should be, because Liszt put some of the very best of himself into this composition.\n\nFranz Liszt Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Christus (Oratorio)\nLabel: Brilliant Classics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 99951\nFormat: 3 Ãƒâ€” CD \nCountry: Netherlands\nReleased: 2007\nGenre: Classical\n\n\nWeihnachtsoratorium/Christmas Oratorio \n1-1 Introduction\t\n1-2 Pastorale And Herald Angel's Song\t\t\n1-3 Stabat Mater Speciosa\t\t\n1-4 Pastoral Music At The Manger\t\t\n1-5 March Of The Three Magi\t\n\t\nAfter Epiphany \n2-1 The Beatitudes\t\t\n2-2 The Lord's Prayer\t\t\n2-3 The Founding Of The Church\t\t\n2-4 The Miracle\t\t\n2-5 Ride Into Jerusalem\t\n\nPassion And Resurrection \n3-1 Tristis Est Anima Mea\t\t\n3-2 Stabat Mater Dolorosa\t\t\n3-3 O Filii Et Filiae\t\t\n3-4 Resurrexit\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8d123d57dcc83f78c66230d592a2e0029c2fc5","amp;dn":"Franz+Liszt+-+Christus+%28Oratorio%29+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8d123d57dcc83f78c66230d592a2e0029c2fc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,141,18,61,87,220,200,63,120,198,98,48,213,146,162,224,2,156,47,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
