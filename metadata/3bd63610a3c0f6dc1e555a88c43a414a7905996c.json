It took a long time to download from their link so I thought I would up it here to grab via torrent.\n\nThis is the first torrent I've upped, not sure what the rules are but needless to say it's not my fix, massive props to noSTEAM for that.  I'm up to mid-October so far.\n\nUsual method applies, copy the patch into your save game folder, that contains the FM.exe file and run the patch. Play the game!!\n\nAS it's my first upload, I'd appreciate if others could verify here that it is indeed kosher.\n\nCheers\n\nRydswyld.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bd63610a3c0f6dc1e555a88c43a414a7905996c","amp;dn":"Working+Football+Manager+Patch%2C+Crash+FIx%2C+noSTEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bd63610a3c0f6dc1e555a88c43a414a7905996c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,214,54,16,163,192,246,220,30,85,90,136,196,58,65,74,121,5,153,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
