Atticus has a history of messing with the gods, and in this eBook original novella, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to outfox a deity at her own deadly cat-and-mouse game.\n \nWhen heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not vanquishing villainous gods or dodging demons, two-thousand-year-old Druid Atticus OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Sullivan can be found behind the counter of Third Eye Books and Herbs in modern-day Tempe, Arizona, literally minding his own business. But when an evil sorcererÃ¢â‚¬â€and amateur shoplifterÃ¢â‚¬â€snatches an ancient Egyptian tome of black magic, The Grimoire of the Lamb, Atticus is not sheepish about pursuing him to the ends of the earth . . . or at least to the Land of the Pharaohs.\n \nUnfortunatel,y Atticus already has enemies in EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â€including cat goddess Bast, who wants her own book of mischief back from the Druid. In the streets of Cairo, she sends a feline phalanx after Atticus and his Irish wolfhound, Oberon. With fur still flying, Atticus must locate the sorcererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret lairÃ¢â‚¬â€where he will face killer crocodiles, spooky sarcophagi, and an ancient evil Egyptian whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to order the sacrificial lamb special tonight.\n \nIncludes a preview of Kevin HearneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly anticipated new novel in The Iron Druid Chronicles, Hunted!\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set in 2005, four years before HOUNDED. Aenghus Ãƒâ€œg hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found him yet, Granuaile isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bartending at RÃƒÂºla BÃƒÂºla, but we do get a cameo from the widow MacDonagh. Hope you dig itÃ¢â‚¬â€please share and spread the word!\n\nCover image: bayimg.com/KaMKIAaej\n\n**This is my first torrent, so any feedback is appreciated!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d713a97f36f3ad46a5d1a9384cc2bf078ebdc36c","amp;dn":"Kevin+Hearne+-+The+Grimoire+of+the+Lamb+%28The+Iron+Druid+Chronicl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d713a97f36f3ad46a5d1a9384cc2bf078ebdc36c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,19,169,127,54,243,173,70,165,209,169,56,76,194,191,7,142,189,195,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
