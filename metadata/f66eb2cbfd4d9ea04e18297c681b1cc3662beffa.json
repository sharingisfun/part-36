In Perfect Condition, i like to hear it the way it is meant to sound. Thats why my audio uploads will be in FLAC!\n\nFLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a codec (compressor-decompressor) which allows digital audio to be losslessly compressed such that file size is reduced without any information being lost. Digital audio compressed by FLAC's algorithm can typically be reduced to 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“60% of its original size, and decompressed into an identical copy of the original audio data.\n\nFLAC is an open format with royalty-free licensing and a reference implementation which is free software. FLAC has support for metadata tagging, album cover art, and fast seeking.\n\nThough FLAC playback support in portable audio devices and dedicated audio systems is limited compared to formats like MP3 or uncompressed PCM, FLAC is supported by more hardware devices than competing lossless compressed formats like WavPack.\n\nSupport the artist and Purchase Their Music!!\n\n\nWest spent the first half of 2010 in Honolulu, Hawaii, working on his new album with the working title &quot;Good Ass Job&quot;, later named My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, released on November 22, 2010.[69] West has cited Maya Angelou, Gil Scott-Heron and Nina Simone as his musical inspirations for this album. Outside production is said to come from RZA, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, and DJ Premier.[70][71] West also had Justin Vernon flown into his studio on Oahu after seemingly expressing interest in sampling one of Bon Iver's songs; Vernon proceeded to feature on a number of new tracks, including &quot;Lost In The World,&quot; which features Vernon's vocal line from Woods.[72]\n\nOn May 28, the Dwele-assisted first single from the album, entitled &quot;Power&quot;, leaked to the Internet. On June 30, the track was officially released via iTunes. The upcoming music video was quoted as being &quot;apocalyptic, in a very personal way&quot; by the director Marco Brambilla.[73]\n\nOn September 12, 2010, West performed a new song, &quot;Runaway&quot; featuring Pusha T, at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.[74] Shortly after the performance, Kanye revealed he was working on a 35 minute short film based around the song. The movie is said to be influenced by film noir and concerns a fallen phoenix whom Kanye falls in love with.[75] On October 15, 2010, Kanye West was ranked 3rd in BET's &quot;Top Ten Rappers of the 21st Century&quot; list.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f66eb2cbfd4d9ea04e18297c681b1cc3662beffa","amp;dn":"Kanye+West+-+My+Beautiful+Dark+Twisted+Fantasy+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f66eb2cbfd4d9ea04e18297c681b1cc3662beffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,110,178,203,253,77,158,160,78,24,41,124,104,27,28,195,102,43,239,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
