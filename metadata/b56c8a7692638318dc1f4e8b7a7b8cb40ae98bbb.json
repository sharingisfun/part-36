Now it's here, and it may not only be the battle of his life-but of Joe's.\n\nIn 1995, Nate was in a secret Special Forces unit abroad when a colleague did something terrible. Now high up in the government, the man is determined to eliminate anyone who knows about it, and Nate knows exactly how he'll do it-by striking at Nate's friends to draw him out. The entire Pickett family will be a target, and the only way to fight back is outside the law. Nate knows he can do it, but he isn't sure about his straight-arrow friend-and all their lives could depend on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b56c8a7692638318dc1f4e8b7a7b8cb40ae98bbb","amp;dn":"Force+of+Nature+-+C+J+Box+%28.mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b56c8a7692638318dc1f4e8b7a7b8cb40ae98bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,108,138,118,146,99,131,24,220,31,78,139,122,123,140,180,10,233,139,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
