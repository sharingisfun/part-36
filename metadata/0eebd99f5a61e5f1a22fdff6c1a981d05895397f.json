This painstakingly illustrated book celebrates the Great Dynasties of English Royalty, from the establishment of the monarchical power base by the early Norman Kings through to the present Queen. The stories of the many monarchs and their colourful lives - some merry, some cruel, some heroic, others sinister - are presented by Antonia Fraser and a collection of specialist contributors who examine the histories of well loved monarchs such as Victoria as well as the lesser known such as Richard III. This edition includes a new essay detailing the recently tumultuous reign of the Windsors. This is a glittering story of a thousand years of English history, as told through the lives and deeds of the nation's sovereigns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eebd99f5a61e5f1a22fdff6c1a981d05895397f","amp;dn":"Antonia+Fraser+-+The+Lives+of+the+Kings+and+Queens+of+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eebd99f5a61e5f1a22fdff6c1a981d05895397f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,235,217,159,90,97,229,241,162,47,223,246,193,169,129,208,88,149,57,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
