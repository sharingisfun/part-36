But as he approached the autumn of his career, Thierryâ€™s crown began to slip â€“ from the infamous â€˜Hand of Gaulâ€™ incident to a dismal World Cup 2010 campaign. Suddenly, a player who Arsene Wenger once dubbed â€˜the greatest striker everâ€™, a man who had spent his career at the very top of the game, began to learn how lonely such a position could be.\r\n\r\nDrawing from numerous interviews and impeccable sources, as well as his own observations over the course of Henryâ€™s entire career, award-winning author Philippe Auclair has produced the most complete portrait of the Arsenal hero ever to be written. Clear-eyed, lyrical and passionately argued, Thierry Henry: Lonely at the Top is as raw, shocking and thought-provoking as it is celebratory of Henryâ€™s outstanding flair and talent.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Superb . . . a thoroughly recommended readâ€™ James Olley, Evening Standard\r\n\r\nâ€˜Illuminated by finely turned phrases and vivid insightsâ€™ Richard Williams, Guardian Sports Books of the Year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156e6ed6dfb04e8bd51ca218b9c2e2ae92528bc6","amp;dn":"Thierry+Henry+-+Lonely+at+the+Top+%282013%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156e6ed6dfb04e8bd51ca218b9c2e2ae92528bc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,110,110,214,223,176,78,139,213,28,162,24,185,194,226,174,146,82,139,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
