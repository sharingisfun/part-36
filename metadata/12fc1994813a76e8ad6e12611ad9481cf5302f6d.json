Rex, released in 1973. Tanx\nwas a hit in UK and Europe but it failed to emulate the success of The Slider in\nthe U.S., reaching only #102 in the album charts. It was critically derided by\njournalists[citation needed] who said the darker, adult sound was a complete\ndeparture from the unique melodic rock and roll that made the band famous.\n\nIt predates punk in some ways, with largely darker and more aggressive songs,\nand shorter songs than the previous two T. Rex albums [&quot;Electric Warrior&quot; and\n&quot;The Slider&quot;] with 9 of the songs less than three minutes long [by comparison,\n&quot;Get It On&quot; was 4:24], akin to Bolan's previous albums under the name\nTyrannosaurus Rex and the debut album under the abbreviated &quot;T. Rex&quot; name\n[all of which had no more than 2 songs over three minutes per album]. &quot;Tanx&quot; is\nalso the first album notably to incorporate elements of soul music, further\nexplored in the following album, &quot;Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of\nTomorrow&quot;, and other subsequent T. Rex albums. Likewise, it's the beginning of\nBolan's marked departure from the glam rock style which he originated and\nhelped popularize, preceding contemporary David Bowie's departure from glam\nand move towards soul music with his album, &quot;Young Americans&quot;, by nearly 2\nyears \n\n\n\n \nAll tracks composed by Marc Bolan, except where indicated.\n\n\n  01. &quot;Tenement Lady&quot; ~ 2:55\n  02. &quot;Rapids&quot; ~ 2:48\n  03. &quot;Mister Mister&quot; ~ 3:29\n  04. &quot;Broken Hearted Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n  05. &quot;Shock Rock&quot; ~ 1:43\n  06. &quot;Country Honey&quot; ~ 1:47\n  07. &quot;Electric Slim and the Factory Hen&quot; ~ 3:03\n  08. &quot;Mad Donna&quot; ~ 2:16\n  09. &quot;Born to Boogie&quot; ~ 2:04\n  10. &quot;Life is Strange&quot; ~ 2:30\n  11. &quot;The Street and Babe Shadow&quot; ~ 2:18\n  12. &quot;Highway Knees&quot; ~ 2:34\n  13. &quot;Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys&quot; ~ 5:18\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:34:56\nTotal Size...........: 232.47 MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nMarc Bolan ~ vocals, guitar\nMickey Finn ~ conga, hand percussion, vocals\nSteve Currie ~ bass\nBill Legend ~ drums\nTony Visconti ~ mellotron, string arrangements\nCasey Howard ~ saxophone\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12fc1994813a76e8ad6e12611ad9481cf5302f6d","amp;dn":"T.Rex+-+Tanx+1973+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12fc1994813a76e8ad6e12611ad9481cf5302f6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,252,25,148,129,58,118,232,173,110,18,97,26,217,72,28,245,48,47,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
