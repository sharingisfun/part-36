But that\nwas a long time ago, and Eboracum slowly turned into a\nmagnificent graveyard of marble palaces, populated by\nthe living, breathing ghosts of a fallen empire. Until a\nyoung monarch in the south, a Briton called Arthur pulled\nthe enchanted sword out of the stone and changed everything.\n\nAnd now, after the catastrophe has struck in the south and the\nOnce and Future King lies wounded, the time is right to make the\nformer provinces great again. The fate of the Romans lies in the\nhands of a noble man called Septimus Sulla. Betrayed and full of\nanger, he embarks on his quest to restore the glory of Eboracum.\nNothing will deter him: he will wage war against both the savages\nof the north and his fellow nobles he will unearth the secrets of\nHadrian's Wall and he will even venture into the mists of the\nunderworld to find to the fabled ghost legions of Rome.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n1.
