Though these artists were extremely popular in the\nGerman speaking areas of Europe, some never made a dent in the English\nspeaking regions. Naively, most of these bands are categorized in that so\ncalled &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; category that Americans use ignorantly and\negocentrically for U.K. &amp; European Artists that only have one &quot;hit&quot; in the\nUS. Most of these so called &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; bands have multiple hits as well as Gold &amp; Platinum record sales around the world. Many of the artists are still\nmaking music 20 or 30 years later.\n\n    Some of the most popular Artists of that scene are Nena, Falco, Peter Schilling, Trio, DAF, Hubert Kah, and Nina Hagen. Sadly, one of the most\ntalented individuals that is often overlooked in the Western World is\nAnnette Humpe and her sister Inga Humpe. They have been in some of the\nbiggest bands of the German New Wave scene ever; Ideal, Neonbabies, DOF,\nHumpe Humpe, and Swimming With Sharks.\n\n(Note: DOF was intended as a comedy album, but had a monstrous music hit\nwith Codo.)\n\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\nNEONBABIES\nNeonbabies LP 1981\nHarmless LP 1982\n1983 LP 1983\n\nIDEAL\nIdeal  1980\nDer Ernst des Lebens 1981\nBi Nuu 1983\n\nDÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œF\nDÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œF 1983\nDay and Night 1985\n\nHUMPE-HUMPE\nHumpe-Humpe 1985\n\nSWIMMING WITH SHARKS\nSwimming with Sharks  1987","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16133c6c09f22cc243b098a36e44c785c456017c","amp;dn":"Humpe+Sisters+Projects+-+%28Neue+Deeutsche+Welle+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9CNDW%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16133c6c09f22cc243b098a36e44c785c456017c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,19,60,108,9,242,44,194,67,176,152,163,110,68,199,133,196,86,1,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
