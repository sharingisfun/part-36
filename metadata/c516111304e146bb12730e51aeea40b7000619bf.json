PEPPER\\'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND - MFSL SEALED LP -\n\nThis is a MFSL Super Virgin Vinyl  200 GRAM UHQR JVC Half-Speed Japanese BOX SET Pressing. THESE WERE VERY LIMITED PRESSINGS FROM THE 80\\'S. THEY WERE THE FIRST EVER HEAVY VINYL AUDIOPHILE PRESSINGS. IT\\'S A TRUE COLLECTORS DREAM TO OWN ONE OF THESE MASTERPIECES.\n\nTHE UHQR BY MFSL WERE THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY-ADVANCED RECORD CONCEIVED.

EACH UHQR IS ELEGANTLY BOXES AND PROTECTIVELY PACKAGED. PRESSINGS WERE STRICTLY LIMITED TO 5000 EDITIONS, EACH ONE HAND NUMBERED FOR AUTHENTICITY. \n\n\nSide A\n\n   1. Sgt.
