Chatgilialoglu, A. Studer (Wiley, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nHighlighting the growing applications of free radicals in key chemical, biological and medical processes\r\n\r\nOver the last two decades the application of free radicals in organic synthesis, materials science and life science has steadily increased, this Encyclopedia presents methodologies and mechanisms involving free radicals of chemical and biological research, including applications in materials science and medicine.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this Encyclopedia is to offer for the first time a description of free radicals within an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary context, connecting structural characteristics and chemical properties to their applications in different areas of chemistry and related disciplines.\r\n\r\nIt covers not only basic concepts and chemical synthesis, but also touches on various aspects concerning the role of free radicals in materials and life sciences. The reader will find a balanced contribution of topics related to free radicals covering for example, their role in proteomics, genomics and lipidomics as well as their enormous potential in synthesis and technology.\r\n\r\nCovers topical areas such as:\r\n\r\nAlzheimer's disease and antioxidants in food within medicine and life sciences\r\nSynthesis and catalysis, combustion and atmospheric chemistry within chemistry\r\nAgeing and signalling in biological processes\r\n\r\nOf interest to anybody working in the field of free radicals in the broadest sense. It will address scientists who want to enter the interdisciplinary field of free radicals. In particular, it is aimed primarily at chemists and life science researchers who want to gain a wider and deeper understanding of free radicals which will allow them to apply free radicals in their own scientific field.\r\n\r\nThe book consists of four themed volumes:\r\n\r\nBasic Concepts &amp; Methodologies\r\nSynthetic Strategies &amp; Applications\r\nChemical Biology\r\nPolymers &amp; Materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a7972280ebfe8a94be8380be264844375ebadc","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Radicals+in+Chemistry%2C+Biology+and+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a7972280ebfe8a94be8380be264844375ebadc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,167,151,34,128,235,254,138,148,190,131,128,190,38,72,68,55,94,186,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
