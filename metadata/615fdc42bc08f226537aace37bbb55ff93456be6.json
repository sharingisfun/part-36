They will learn how to prepare wood surfaces before burning, how to transfer a design or pattern, and how to select materials for burning, colouring, and finishing a project. Methods for burning onto wood, leather, paper, bark, and antlers are detailed alongside ample pictures of pyrography on the various materials that will inspire novice wood-burners. Numerous techniques are also discussed, including solar, negative, relief, engraving, torch, and hot wire. The most difficult area for burners - how to realistically create animal fur, feathers, and eyes - is addressed. \n\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 138 pages\n# Publisher: Fox Chapel Publishing (15 Dec 2005)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 1565232585\n# ISBN-13: 978-1565232587","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:615fdc42bc08f226537aace37bbb55ff93456be6","amp;dn":"Pyrography+Workbook%3AA+Complete+Guide+to+the+Art+of+Woodburning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"615fdc42bc08f226537aace37bbb55ff93456be6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,95,220,66,188,8,242,38,83,122,172,227,123,187,85,255,147,69,107,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
