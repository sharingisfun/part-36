The movie is a story of a taxi driver named Jerzy (short: Jurek) Kiler who is mistaken for a notorious mercenary killer by the police as well as the mafia.\n\n  Cezary Pazura  ...

Camera Operator  \n\n\nSeeing the movie's tremendous success in Poland, Hollywood quickly purchased the rights to the movie, with the intention to adapt it for the American market, with Machulski (the original director) as the executive producer. However, nothing of the sort has happened since.\n\nFilms produced in Poland in the nineties try to establish their identity as a part of European and world culture not only in terms of economics. Despite the growing number of co-productions with Western partners, the majority of Polish film production is still fully financed from domestic sources. Yet those films are more and more for export. \n\nKiler managed to gather popular cinema enthusiasts and art house audiences: it was both popular and rated very highly by most film critics. Yet it clearly defines itself as a non-serious, fun production. \n\nAt the very beginning we learn that Polish gangsters prepare a deal to sell the Palace of Culture, a famous Warsaw building presented by Soviets to our country, to some foreign investors. This abstract and impossible situation moves the story to a level that is later defined as intertextual. \n\nInstead of relating the story to any experiences of the viewer, the director calls for his cinema competence. Kiler builds on clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and admits it in many ways. \n\nIn one of the scenes Jurek Kiler, a taxi driver mistaken for a famous hit man, builds his image from popular films. After watching The Taxi Driver by Martin Scorsese, Leon: The Professional by Luc Besson and a couple other films he poses like the protagonists of the movies that inspired him. \n\nHe also chooses one Polish film, Psy by Wladyslaw Pasikowski, an almost perfect copy of American action movies. Parodying the character created by one of his colleagues, Boguslaw Linda, with whom Cezary Pazura (Jurek Kiler in MachulskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movie) often stars, the protagonist assures the viewer that Polish movies (both Psy and Kiler) are part of a larger-than-Polish tradition. \n\nKiler also defines a new function of cinema. Juliusz Machulski seems to admit that his movie is more a sophisticated product than an artistic event. Its goal is to entertain and do it well, to provide consumer-like satisfaction. \n\nNot only the protagonists are defined as members of consumer society, but the movie itself encourages its audience to consume. Kiler is one of the first Polish movies to use intensive tie-in product placement techniques. \n\nThe producers signed contracts with some companies to show their products in a positive context in the movie. Thus, nearly all protagonists drive Nissans (from Micra to a sports coupe), they watch Nasza Television (owned by the distributor), read Viva weekly and use Era GSM mobile phones. \n\nThe strategy is used in many foreign movies, but in MachulskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film some products (especially the cars) are ever-present. Their presentation is not simply in keeping with the terms of the agreement with the sponsors, but denotes a certain shift in Polish cinema, which starts to operate in the market to fulfil certain consumer needs of the audience. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a2a5e5ffc49964505148333142fec6e6d8b9d1","amp;dn":"Kiler+%28eng+subs%29+%5B1997%5D+Juliusz+Machulski","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a2a5e5ffc49964505148333142fec6e6d8b9d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,162,165,229,255,196,153,100,80,81,72,51,49,66,254,198,230,216,185,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
