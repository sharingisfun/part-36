When asked for registration, use the provided details. Block internet access to the application to prevent serial verification! Done! Enjoy!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRun a full web or cloud environment on your PC, including VMware Micro Cloud Foundry. Run as a server to share virtual machines with your team, department, or anyone in your organization. Remotely connect to virtual machines running on VMware vSphere. Simply drag and drop to move virtual machines to a VMware vSphere server. Run, share, connect, or move virtual machines, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole new way to work.\n\nRun applications in Linux, Windows, and more at the same time on the same PC without rebooting. Evaluate and test new operating systems, applications and patches in an isolated environment. Demonstrate complex software applications on a single laptop in a repeatable, reliable manner. Rich integration with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and the SpringSource Tool Suite make it incredibly easy to test applications on multiple platforms.\n\nCreate virtual machines with up to 8 virtual processors or 8 virtual cores, 2 TB virtual disks and up to 64 GB of memory per virtual machine to run the most demanding applications. Protect your virtual machines from prying eyes with 256-bit AES encryption and smart card authentication.\n\nVMware Workstation was the first to support 3D graphics in virtualized environments and was the first to support Windows Aero in Windows Vista and Windows 7 virtual machines. Run even more 3D applications with support for DirectX 9.0c Shader Model 3 and OpenGL 2.13D graphics in Windows virtual machines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba9d6217dbad15c067a7f4052645fafb8a2525be","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation+8.0.3+%2B+Serials.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba9d6217dbad15c067a7f4052645fafb8a2525be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,157,98,23,219,173,21,192,103,167,244,5,38,69,250,251,138,37,37,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
