Although the production code was still somewhat in force, it had loosened up quite a bit since the days of NATIONAL VELVET, and while scenes stop short at the bedroom door they have plenty of sizzle while they walk up to it; moreover, every one in the film talks about sex so much you'd think it had just been invented. Taylor is on record saying that she considers the film a piece of trash, and she swears she has never actually seen it, that she would rather die than ever see it.\n\nBut something weird happened as the camera rolled. Taylor, doubtlessly driven by her fury at having to do the movie, gives a throw-away, over-the-top performance--but perversely, this is precisely what the role requires, and her performance was successful enough to earn her an Oscar. The supporting cast follows her lead, all of them performing in broad colors and bigger-than-life emotions, and again they too are quite successful, with Laurence Harvey and Dina Merrill (as his long suffering wife) particularly effective. Ultimately, of course, Elizabeth Taylor is quite right when she says the film is a piece of trash. But it is the best kind of trash because it is so completely trashy: BUTTERFIELD 8 doesn't just dive into the trash pile, it wallows in it with considerable conviction. Modern films of the same type may show more skin and more sex, but for sheer authority BUTTERFIELD 8 remains a standard against which most of them pale. Not every one will like it, but I recommend it all the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Nero Digital AVC HDTV Profile\nCodec ID                         : ndxh\nFile size                        : 1.35 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 776 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2010-08-18 06:55:21\nTagged date                      : UTC 2010-08-18 17:02:11\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6129080609212d524f51&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 2 frames\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1 658 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 6 725 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.177\nStream size                      : 1.26 GiB (93%)\nLanguage                         : English\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2010-08-18 06:55:21\nTagged date                      : UTC 2010-08-18 17:02:11\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nFormat settings, SBR             : Yes\nFormat settings, PS              : No\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 116 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 154 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 89.7 MiB (7%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nSorry no Subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f14156c716282c0b55ed4bf8efe122ca5eece83","amp;dn":"Butterfield+8+1960++x264+AVC+Elizabeth+Taylor+Eddie+Fisher-Class","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f14156c716282c0b55ed4bf8efe122ca5eece83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,20,21,108,113,98,130,192,181,94,212,191,142,254,18,44,165,238,206,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
