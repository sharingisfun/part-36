He is the founder of Ricky MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n Foundation (in Spanish FundaciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n Ricky Martin) a non-profit charity organization.\nIn 2008, he became a single father of twin boys, Matteo and Valentino.\nMartin has been nominated one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World by People magazine and its sister magazine People en EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol in 2000 and 2006 respectively.\nIn the past Ricky stated he was in love with Mexican TV host Rebecca de Alba, with whom he had an off and on again relationship for over 14 years. They even talked of starting a family together. And at one point Ricky Martin planned on proposing. However with the release of &quot;Life&quot;, Martin confirmed he and De Alba had parted ways. \nDuring the Livin' la Vida Loca era, Martin's personal life went under the microscope due to his large gay following and he was constantly questioned about his sexual orientation. Neither avoiding the questions nor answering that he is straight stopped the gay rumors. In the magazine Plus 7 Days he said: &quot;I am a modern man, live a full life, do not feel any barriers inside myself,&quot; Ricky says. &quot;I perceive the contemporary world as an open forum, where nothing is taboo except criminal activity. If I were gay, why not admit it? ... I am a normal man. I love women and sex. I am a real hot-blooded Puerto Rican, but I have never been attracted by sex with a man.&quot; In The Sunday Express on the gay rumors Martin said: &quot;What are you going to do? I don't have a problem with homosexuality. I'm gay-friendlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I'm not gay\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bf75ed42c70e010344480e9e992e4a31493eee2","amp;dn":"Ricky+Martin-10+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bf75ed42c70e010344480e9e992e4a31493eee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,247,94,212,44,112,224,16,52,68,128,233,233,146,228,163,20,147,238,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
