Given short shrift or overlooked by many historians, the Hampton Roads Conference of 1865 was a crucial turning point in the War between the States. In this well written and highly documented book, James B. Conroy describes in fascinating detail what happened when leaders from both sides came together to try to end the hostilities. The meeting was meant to end the fighting on peaceful terms. It failed, however, and the war dragged on for two more bloody, destructive months. Through meticulous research of both primary and secondary sources, Conroy tells the story of the doomed peace negotiations through the characters who lived it. With a fresh and immediate perspective, Our One Common Country offers a thrilling and eye-opening look into the inability of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders to find a peaceful solution. The failure of the Hamptons Roads Conference shaped the course of American history and the future of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wars to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cfcc3b387c2632b75a3fedd1ccf7e78fcba1bf5","amp;dn":"Our+One+Common+Country_+Abraham+-+James+B.+Conroy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cfcc3b387c2632b75a3fedd1ccf7e78fcba1bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,252,195,179,135,194,99,43,117,163,254,221,28,207,126,120,252,186,27,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
