Unfortunately that disables multithreading. Making it no better than v1.0.5.\r\n\r\nIf the world doesn't render with the gfx-direct option then you can try also adding -force-glcore.\r\n\r\nFor example. My full launch command is:\r\n./KSP.x86_64 -screen-fullscreen 0 -screen-width 1920 -screen-height 1000 -force-glcore -force-gfx-direct\r\n\r\nTorrent from\nMany thanks to them for bringing us this release.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: http://postimg.org/image/obkwarrup/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f57b1511fa8d8b60abc7077476ec0893beba66","amp;dn":"Kerba+Program+LINUX+v1.1.2.1260","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f57b1511fa8d8b60abc7077476ec0893beba66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,245,123,21,17,250,141,139,96,171,199,7,116,118,236,8,147,190,186,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
