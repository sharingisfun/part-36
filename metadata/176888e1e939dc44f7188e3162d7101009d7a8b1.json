The new LP features straight-out, hard-hitting pop songs, wrapped around JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s razor-sharp lyrics and acute observations. Lyrically, he finds himself talking about everything from the sublime to the ordinary, eloquently depicting life in England in JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very own inimitable way.\n\n\n1.
