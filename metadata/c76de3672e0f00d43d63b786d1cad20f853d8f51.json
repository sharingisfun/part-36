It was written and recorded specifically as an attempt at a hit single, released only days after being recorded. The previous year had been commercially disastrous for The Kinks. Their two singles had failed to reach the top 10 in the UK and failed to chart at all in the US. The album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society had also failed to chart in both the UK and US. \n\nThe plan for a hit backfired when the use of the word 'bum' (in the line &quot;...plastic legs that reach up to his plastic bum&quot;) meant that the BBC refused to play the song. The single only managed to reach #31 in the UK and the following two Kinks singles failed to chart altogether. The single was not released in the US, only being released in the US on The Great Lost Kinks Album in 1973. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Man_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Man_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 704x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 7600kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:03\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
