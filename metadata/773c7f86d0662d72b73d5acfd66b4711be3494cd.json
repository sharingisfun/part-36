Brawny mountains, burning deserts, tangled forests and curvaceous coasts. A grizzly bear takedown of helpless elk calves in Yellowstone. Big horn sheep going head-to-head in battle. Giant Humboldt squid cannibalizing their kin. Mountain lion cubs hunting solo for the first time. The landscapes and wildlife of the Americas are savage, shrewd and stunning. These are the great outdoors, our wildest frontiers - our Untamed Americas. National Geographic`s four-hour mini-series, Untamed Americas, explores some of the greatest wildlife spectacles and against-the-odds fights for survival in the continents` mountains, deserts, coasts and forests. Narrated by actor Josh Brolin\n\n\n\n3)  Forests \nA journey through the forests of the Americas is one of extremes flood, freeze and fire. The animals that live there not only endure, but adapt and thrive in surprising ways. As the flood season arrives in the Amazon rain forest, witness the mighty Amazon River burst its banks and transform a lush rain forest into a watery world where river dolphins hunt along the forest floor and an elusive jaguar takes down a caiman crocodile with stunning expertise.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2043 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Extra Run-time 50mins 700MB\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/untamed-americas/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/untamed-americas/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:773c7f86d0662d72b73d5acfd66b4711be3494cd","amp;dn":"NG+Untamed+Americas+3of4+Forests+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"773c7f86d0662d72b73d5acfd66b4711be3494cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,60,127,134,208,102,45,114,183,61,90,207,214,107,71,17,190,52,148,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
