What would you do if the power went out for several days in a row? Or if your family had to quickly evacuate the area?\n\nKathy Harrison shows you how to set up a simple home system--covering food storage, alternative heating sources, toiletries and clothing, pet supplies, emergency communication plans, and more--that will allow your household to survive comfortably for several days, or longer, with no outside services at all. Harrison also explains how to create a detailed evacuation plan--where to go, how to meet up with other family members, what to pack, and how to protect what you leave behind.\n\nKeep a cool head and plan well; your family will be able to settle in together, stay warm, and eat well when the unexpected happens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ee6335e5aae2de693aa2bbf5a74d833eeed5fdb","amp;dn":"Just+in+Case+-+How+to+Be+Self-Sufficient++-+Kathy+Harrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ee6335e5aae2de693aa2bbf5a74d833eeed5fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,230,51,94,90,174,45,230,147,170,43,191,90,116,216,51,238,237,95,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
