Expanding on issues touched on in The Da Vinci Code, this thought-provoking book explores the real story of Christianity, a story told by men and women who were condemned by the Orthodox church, a story long hidden in mysterious codes and symbols. In medieval times, dissenters believed the established church ruthlessly suppressed the truth about Jesus and his ministry. Branded as heretics and subject to torture and execution for their beliefs, the dissenters - including the Knights Templar, Freemasons, Cathars, and scientists - devised an ingenious code to communicate with fellow sympathizers and preserve the truth for future generations. The code was concealed in complex symbols that were hidden in the art, artifacts, and architecture of the medieval world. Cracking the Symbol Code deciphers this fascinating underground language, revealing powerful messages that were meant as much for todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s truth seekers as for medieval minds. 315 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d329a749e6e35c7bdb3d6ddc5be9bdc2a4dd61","amp;dn":"Wallace-Murphy-Cracking+Symbol+Code-Revealing+Secret+Heretical+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d329a749e6e35c7bdb3d6ddc5be9bdc2a4dd61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,211,41,167,73,230,227,92,123,219,61,109,220,91,233,189,194,164,221,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
