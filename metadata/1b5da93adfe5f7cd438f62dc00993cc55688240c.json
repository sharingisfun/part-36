I don't have constant online access, which is why I needed to 'wget' this site. That being said, Please seed, I'll probably drop my part in a few days. All the links should work fine, I know the mirror stopped at around 13,000 pages. I haven't found any broken links yet but if there please report below.\r\n\r\nBasically, after you unzip, go to php.net-&gt;manual-&gt;en, and then click on any page. Once the page loads into your browser, just click on the link to the manual section.\r\n\r\nIf anyone manages to read the entire thing...You have waaaaaaay too much time on your hands.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, its almost 500mb after you unzip it. Don't let the size of the zipped file fool you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5da93adfe5f7cd438f62dc00993cc55688240c","amp;dn":"PHP+Study+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5da93adfe5f7cd438f62dc00993cc55688240c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,93,169,58,223,229,247,205,67,143,98,220,0,153,60,197,86,136,36,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
