DJ Hype is widely considered one of the pillars of modern drum and bass, with a pivotal role in expanding musical styles within that genre.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was an early DJ on one of Londons pirate stations, Fantasy FM, and has been popular on the international DJ circuit, landing awards for Best Male DJ and Best Radio DJ (in 1994 and 1995, respectively) at the U.K.s Hardcore Awards. He is also one of the London radio station Kiss 100s main attractions, and was a player in Suburban Bases compilation series, Drum and Bass Selection. A champion of jungleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢s dancefloor purity, DJ Hype has also rallied consistently against jungle's compartmentalization into artificial scenes in the late 1990s.\n\nDJ Hype began producing in 1989, engineering and co-producing tracks (including chart-toppers such as Exorcist and The Bee) for hardcore staples Kickin, Strictly Underground, and Suburban Base. Although he never lost touch with his breakbeat roots (even going so far as to spin hip-hop instrumentals over house tracks to add a bit of rhythmic flair), it wasnt until he launched his own Ganja label in 1994 (with the single Cops) that he began seriously focusing on the post-rave possibilities of sampled breaks.\n\nThe Ganja label gained almost immediate popularity, primarily through floor-fillers such as &quot;You Must Think First&quot;, &quot;Tiger Style&quot; and DJ Zincs Super Sharp Shooter. That popularity peaked with the release of their first LP in 1996: 'Still Smokin, a label compilation released jointly by Ganja and cohort Pascals Frontline imprint. The album became one of the highest-selling independent jungle compilations. Re-released in 1997, its success also led to a major label deal with MCAs Parousia sublabel and the establishment of True Playaz, a DJ Hypeled DJ and production unit also including DJ Zinc, Pascal, and Rude Bwoy Monty.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       DJ HYPE Various Sets \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: OK, (avg. bitrate: 150kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.0, ID3 v2.3, APE v2,000\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Mix listing\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
