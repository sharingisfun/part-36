It was my privilege to help explain that tool in Step into Xcode: Mac OS X Development. Since then, Apple has released a new operating system, Leopard, and a new Xcode. Xcode 3 is the official development tool for AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s iPhone. Xcode 3 Unleashed is a new edition for a new world.\n\nI wrote Xcode 3 Unleashed for people who are new to Mac programming and to Xcode, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve included plenty of material that will be new even to experienced developers. My approach is to lead you through a simple application project to give you a vocabulary for the workflow of Mac development, and how Xcode and the tools that accompany it fit in. After you have a solid grounding, we can move on to Part II, where the details and more advanced techniques can come out.\n\nPart I is a practical introduction, showing how to use Xcode at every step, from building a command-line tool, to debugging, to building a human interface, to Core Data design and language localization. Companion tools such as Interface Builder and Instruments are essential to developing for the Mac, and I cover them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0337d4a37aca85775e273e7643dba72754aa3dfd","amp;dn":"Xcode+3+unleashed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0337d4a37aca85775e273e7643dba72754aa3dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,55,212,163,122,202,133,119,94,39,62,118,67,219,167,39,84,170,61,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
