A man came in a fur coat from Decca Records, wanted to hear their songs and they went to the studio that night and recorded a demo. Two weeks later they wanted to record an album and he became their manager. They were his American girls. The recorded their one and only album Sound of Sunforest in 1969. Kubrick wanted her to record Overture for the Sun for the soundtrack. It got recorded again, Terry wrote some changes in the arrangement for the film.  It was exciting. It just fell into their lap. In those days they never tried to make anything happen, just follow their nose and it happened. Overture is instrumental, like a little renaissance piece. Terry wrote and arranged it, played harpsichord on it. Lighthouse Keeper is a song that Erica wrote and Terry sang backup on it and played the piano. Terry stayed in England about 12 years and came home to the US after the band broke up.\nLiner Notes\nThe Sun - the beginning\nOf life in out solar system\nThe Symbol, therefore, of creation\nRepresenting joy and love\nThe finest attributes of life\nThe Sun is giving, we receive\nAs inhabitants of this earth\nThe Forest, which contains all\nWherein dwell sheltering trees\nRising to worship the lifegiving sun\nAll animals, plants and finally Man\nInhabit the vast forest of the earth\nDesert, mountain, green valley and sea\nThe Earth, from which spring all creatures\nNature&amp;#039;s art - informed to live\nInspired to create and understand\nIn the light of the giving sun\nAt night we rest by the gentle lamp\nThe moon, the jeweled starts\nThen by the soft brightness of dawn\nPersuaded, we rise again -\nOnce more light and life\nReign silent, strong and pure\nIn the Forest of the Sun\n            Freya Lynn Houge\nA mellowness of cool sound\nVibrations of personality in song\nA gentle harmony of tempered soul\nA rose colored glass filled to capacity\nWith love for music and out neighbors.\nWelcome to Sunforest!\n            Vic Smith\nLyrics\n1. Overture To the Sun\n(Instrumental)\n2. Where Are You\nSee the joker on his way\nThinks that he can rule the day\nGypsy In her caravan\nConnected with another land\n*Sad and funny but it&amp;#039;s not so wise\nThey roam their worlds awhile\nAnticipation in their eyes\nI teach them how to smile in their eyes\nWizard sitting on his throne\nDoesn&amp;#039;t know he&amp;#039;s all alone\nPirates digging in caverns\nDigging gold to pay the taverns\n*Repeat\nSo if you think you&amp;#039;re where you are\nBeware! You&amp;#039;re far away\nA mystery that has no clue\nWhere are you, where are you?\n3. Bonny River\nTry to take a break some time\nAnd walk by the banks of the bonny river\nWhen you&amp;#039;re feeling out of sorts and kind of bad\nYou can walk by the bonny river\nThe bonny river is there for you to take advantage of\nSo when you&amp;#039;re feeling all alone and blue\nYou can think about the one you love\nThe one you love\nSong a little song out underneath the trees\nAs you walk by the bonny river\nSoon you will be just as happy as you please\nIf you walk by the bonny river\n*The bonny river is a way of life that you cannot deny\nThe grass grows tall along the quiet banks\nBeneath the clear blue sky\nThe clear blue sky\n* *So if you&amp;#039;re ever in a bind and life is oh so mean\nIt makes you want to shiver\nTake a little break and come along with me\nBeneath the sun by the bonny river\n* Repeat\n**Repeat\nBy the bonny river, the bonny river...\n4.

Mr. Bumble\nFar away and long ago\nThere lived a Mr. Bumble\nHe did fancy little Miss Bee\nSo they courted then agreed to marry\nOn their wedding day\nThe mantis prayed for their good fortune\nAll the ladybirds did sing\nAnd the dragonfly did bring them silver\nThe groom wore stripes of black\nThe bride was dressed in blushing yellow\nAnd the butterfly ballet\nWas presented in full living colour\nSo they were wed and the sun did shine\nAnd that evening they all did line on pollen\nThey&amp;#039;d been married for ten days\nI&amp;#039;m sure it was not twenty\nLife was full and life was gay\nThey were blessed in everyday with plenty\n&quot;Bumble dear,&quot; said Mrs. Bee\n&quot;There&amp;#039;s something I must tell you\nSoon you&amp;#039;ll hear a tiny buzz\nYou&amp;#039;ll be father of a fuzzy baby&quot;\nEight days later all was quiet\nAs the kingdom waited\nKatie did come round to say\nBumble Bee has come today, be merry\nSo he was born and the sun did shine\nAnd that evening they all did dine on pollen\n6. And I Was Blue\n* And I was blue and broke in two\nFallen on the ground and all around\nAnd I was broke I was broke in two\nAnd I was crying I was crying for you\nCrying, cry\nDo you remember you made me lonely\nI loved you only, you made me blue\nDo you remember how much I cried dear\nCan&amp;#039;t be denied dear you know its true\nDo you remember, I bet you do\nDo you recall win I said I loved you\nVery Ironic you said so too\nYou must be crazy to go on thinking\nThat in the future I&amp;#039;ll be your fool\nIsn&amp;#039;t it time to say we&amp;#039;re through\n* Repeat\n7.
