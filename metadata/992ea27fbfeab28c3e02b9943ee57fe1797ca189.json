Hagberg has also written under the pseudonym Sean Flannery, Nick Carter, David Bannerman, David James, Robert Pell, and Eric Ramsey. Hagberg's style has been described[citation needed] as a cross between Tom Clancy and Ian Fleming. His thrillers generally feature a combination of technical detail, timely plots and super-spy heroics that are sometimes almost prophetic in their accuracy[citation needed]. In the novel Joshua's Hammer, for example, written in 2000, Hagberg gives a chilling account of a mega-terrorist plot by Osama bin Laden to kill thousands of Americans on their home soil, published a full year before the World Trade Center Attacks. His scenario of McGarvey tracking bin Laden to his urban lair in Pakistan and shooting him in the headÃ¢â‚¬â€far from Tora BoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cavesÃ¢â‚¬â€was described and executed in Ã¢â‚¬Å“AllahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Scorpion (2007)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ four years before the eerily similar event echoed HagbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel.\nLike many &quot;cloak-and-dagger&quot; novelists, Hagberg has a professional background in espionage, having spent his stint of military duty as a cryptographer for U.S. Air Force Intelligence. Hagberg apprenticed as a spy writer by contributing more than 20 &quot;work-for-hire&quot; entries in the Nick Carter - Killmaster series of espionage novels between 1976 and 1987. He also wrote &quot;work-for-hire&quot; novels based on the Flash Gordon comic strip. His work has been well received by his colleagues in the crime writing community. Three of his novels, The Kremlin Conspiracy, False Prophets, and Broken Idols, were nominated for Edgars by the MWA in the &quot;Best Paperback Original Novel&quot; category. Three of his McGarvey novels, Countdown, Crossfire, and Critical Mass, won American Mystery Awards, given by Mystery Scene Magazine, for &quot;Best Spy Novel.&quot; Hagberg wrote a short story titled &quot;Genesis&quot; in Twilight Zone: 19 Original Stories on the 50th Anniversary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992ea27fbfeab28c3e02b9943ee57fe1797ca189","amp;dn":"david+hagberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992ea27fbfeab28c3e02b9943ee57fe1797ca189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,46,162,127,191,234,178,140,62,2,185,148,62,229,127,225,121,124,161,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
