This is a dreamy progressive folk album that appears to be a duo augmented by sessions musicians (in the manner of Witthuser + Westrupp but with vocals sung in English). The album does venture out into a tougher rock sound at times while at others it will float on a bed of mellotron sound which hazily recalls the sound of early King Crimson or The Moody Blues. A very interesting and rare album which is well worth a listen.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. The Light (5:54)\n2. I Had A Dream (3:30)\n3. November Church (8:54)\n4. Mr. Clown (2:58)\n5.
