He might be from Oz, but this music is Americana, make no mistake, with a classy yet bleary-eyed Nashville vibe that really reminds us those recent Mickey Newbury reissues, and of course more modern standard-bearers likes Lambchop, Evan Dando and Whiskeytown. The songs are rooted in tradition, but buck convention and predictability: Derrig-HallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar playing is nicely elliptical and digressive, the downhome chamber instrumentation that accompanies him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“banjos, piano, strings arranged by Biddy Connor, crystalline vocal harmonies from the wonderful Tsamoglu ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sparse and haunting, if oddly reassuring too. Refreshingly honest, beautifully written, performed and recorded music for all the broken-hearted cowboys and cowgirls among you.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/12/17/the-singing-skies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/12/17/the-singing-skies/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc8af267b0d6135fe256ed9307f8fa462d08ac7","amp;dn":"The+Singing+Skies...Routine+and+War%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc8af267b0d6135fe256ed9307f8fa462d08ac7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,200,175,38,123,13,97,53,254,37,110,217,48,127,143,164,98,208,138,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
