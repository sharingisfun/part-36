When Walter Byers coined the term student-athlete nearly six decades ago, he may have protected the NCAA from such attempts to classify student-athletes as employees, which would therefore intend for them to be compensated for their services. Schooled: The Price Of College Sports presents arguments for the rights of athletes in the form of a documentary. Arian Foster, Jonathan Franklin, and several other current and former collegiate athletes gave their opinions on the Price of College Sports.\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of Gotham, MST3K, Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5dd4a116c277e32e9b3dadf18fce39ddcc80147","amp;dn":"Schooled+The+Price+Of+College+Sports+2013+720p+2ch+x265+HEVC+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5dd4a116c277e32e9b3dadf18fce39ddcc80147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,221,74,17,108,39,126,50,233,179,218,223,24,252,227,157,220,200,1,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
