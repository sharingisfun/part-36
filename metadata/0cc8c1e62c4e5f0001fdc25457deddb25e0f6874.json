The song remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed. In the US, media scrutiny surrounding alleged antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple apologies and re-recording the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“altering the lyrics for that particular track. The singer countered allegations of antisemitism, arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song, either unintentionally or deliberately. Musically, it is an aggressive hip-hop production about social ills.\n\nThe song was accompanied by two music videos directed by Spike Lee. The first was shot in Brazil, in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses.\n\nCommercially, the song became a top ten hit in all European countries. In the US, radio stations were reluctant to play the controversial composition; it, however, managed to peak at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nProducing the first video proved to be a difficult task for Jackson. State authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in Rio de Janeiro. Officials feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused Jackson of exploiting the poor. Ronaldo Cezar Coelho, the state secretary for Industry, Commerce and Tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product, stating, &quot;I don't see why we should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate Rio's image&quot;. Some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the Olympics in 2004. Others supported Jackson's wish to highlight the problems of the region, arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings. A judge banned all filming but this ruling was overturned by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not. Thousands pushed through security and one fan managed to hug the singer, both of them falling to the floor in the confusion. The woman was escorted away and Jackson continued to sing and dance for the director (the incident can be seen in the finished video). 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta shantytown. It was alleged that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.\n\nThe music video was directed by Spike Lee, asked why he choice Lee to direct the video, Jackson responded, &quot;'They Don't Care About Us' has an edge, and Spike Lee had approached me. It's a public awareness song and that's what he is all about. It's a protest kind of song ... and I think he was perfect for it&quot;. Jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group Olodum, &quot;who swayed to the heavy beat of Salvador's 'samba-reggae' music&quot;. The media interest surrounding the music video exposed Olodum to 140 countries around the world. It brought them worldwide fame and increased their credibility in Brazil.\nPrecarious houses in the favela of Complexo do AlemÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o in Rio de Janeiro.
