Tossed into a garbage dump in a plastic bag, Hell Baby dies, but is brought back to life by an unworldly bolt of lightning. Hell Baby develops hard-earned hunting techniques to survive life among the wild animals who roam the dump. After struggling along for seven years, she seeks revenge for her fate and returns to the city, where she applies her hunting skills for survival--this time against the good citizens of Tokyo. - Blast Books\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nThis is an upload of the entire classic horror manga &quot;Hell Baby&quot;/&quot;Gaki Jigoku&quot;.\nThe images are in .jpg format and are organized by Volume and Chapter Number.\n\nVol. 1.1 = Vol. 1, Chapter 1\n\n(This one is a oneshot, so I couldn't find any chapter titles)\n\nAs always, I'm open to all requests to please comment if you have one!\n\nThanks and keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92420cc02bfe6041885181c4d5dee8a878dae712","amp;dn":"Hell+Baby+%2F+Gaki+Jigoku+Full+Manga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92420cc02bfe6041885181c4d5dee8a878dae712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,66,12,192,43,254,96,65,136,81,129,196,213,222,232,168,120,218,231,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
