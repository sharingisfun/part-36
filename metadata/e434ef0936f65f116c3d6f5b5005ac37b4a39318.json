Some 30 years later, in 2001,\nauthorial matters came to a head in the High Court in London after Norman sued\nThe Sunday Times for publishing that claim in a 1997 article naming Barry as\nthe true composer; Barry testified for the defence. In court, Barry declared he\nhad been handed a musical manuscript of a work by Norman (meant to become the\ntheme) and that he was to arrange it musically, and that he composed additional\nmusic and arranged the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. The court also was told that Norman\nreceived sole credit, because of his prior contract with the producers. The\nverdict was that Monty Norman composed at least part and maybe all of the\n&quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. How much, remains an open question. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barry_(composer)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barry_(composer)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e434ef0936f65f116c3d6f5b5005ac37b4a39318","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+Best+Of+John+Barry+-+Themeology+%5B1997%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e434ef0936f65f116c3d6f5b5005ac37b4a39318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,52,239,9,54,246,95,17,108,61,111,91,80,5,172,55,180,163,147,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
