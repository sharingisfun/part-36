Originally, the series was intended to focus on young people with supernatural powers - which many of the issues indeed do - but as the year progressed, the stories increasingly focused on people, relationships, and emotions, with the &quot;supernatural&quot; angle quietly de-emphasized.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800bb1ed4d4e00cb872bd5f684654fa1d0357328","amp;dn":"Demo+%28AiT%2FPlanet+Lar%29+%28Brian+Wood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800bb1ed4d4e00cb872bd5f684654fa1d0357328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,11,177,237,77,78,0,203,135,43,213,246,132,101,79,161,208,53,115,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
