When he arrived on the scene some had suggested that effective opera after Rossini was not possible. Verdi, however, took the form to new heights of drama and musical expression. Partisans see him as at least the equal of Wagner, even though his style and musical persona were of an entirely different cast. In the end, both Verdi's popular vein -- as heard in the operas Rigoletto, Il trovatore, and La traviata -- and his deeper side -- found in Aida, Otello, and Falstaff -- demonstrate his mastery and far-reaching development of Italian opera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5327ef54d1745acf01d74ba5f89ccb821e21fab6","amp;dn":"Giuseppe+Verdi+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5327ef54d1745acf01d74ba5f89ccb821e21fab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,39,239,84,209,116,90,207,1,215,75,165,248,156,203,130,30,33,250,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
