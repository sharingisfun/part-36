His one-man security detail goes missing as well.\n\n\nRutherford Risk is a firm specializing in extraction: the negotiation for, and the recovery of hostages. Private investigation is illegal in today''s China. Operating within her borders will be difficult at best.\nThe security company recruits two unique outsiders to do their bidding. Grace Chu is a forensic accountant hired to follow the money; John Knox is a civilian with unparalleled training in both combat and culture. Grace's top-notch American education and Chinese military service make her an unassuming, but effective, operative, while Knox's take-no-prisoners attitude brings them perilously close to harm. Following the money leads to more complex - and dangerous - consequences than either anticipated. Who is actually behind the kidnapping? And more important, can Knox and Grace locate the two hostages ahead of the deadline?\n\n\nRich with the atmosphere of Shanghai and crackling with tension-filled suspense, Pearson''s latest introduces two compelling new characters-and heralds in the start of a brilliant new series.\n\nENJOY and SEED !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce34681987d4e1b82c96ab2d71022c8df62c4cf4","amp;dn":"Ridley+Pearson+-+Risk+Agent+%5BEDGE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce34681987d4e1b82c96ab2d71022c8df62c4cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,52,104,25,135,212,225,184,44,150,171,45,113,2,44,141,246,44,76,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
