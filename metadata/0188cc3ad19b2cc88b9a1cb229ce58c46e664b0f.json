It was released on April 28, 1980.\n\nThe album was released for the first time on CD in 1990 by Arista Records before being re-released in 2000 by BMG International. It was then remastered, expanded, and released as part of the Beyond Description (1973-1989) box set in October 2004. The remasted version was later released separately on CD on April 11, 2006 by Rhino Records.\n\nIt was the band&amp;#039;s first album with newcomer keyboard player Brent Mydland replacing both Donna Jean Godchaux&amp;#039;s backup vocals and Keith Godchaux&amp;#039;s piano playing. Much reason for the album&amp;#039;s mixed critical review could by rooted towards the bands transition from Godchaux&amp;#039;s jazzy piano playing to Mydland&amp;#039;s Hammond B3 organ and use of keyboard effects.\n\n\n# &quot;Alabama Getaway&quot; (Garcia, Hunter) ? 3:37\n# &quot;Far From Me&quot; (Mydland) ? 3:39\n# &quot;Althea&quot; (Garcia, Hunter) ? 6:52\n# &quot;Feel Like a Stranger&quot; (Barlow, Weir) ? 5:08\n# &quot;Lost Sailor&quot; (Barlow, Weir)? 5:54\n# &quot;Saint of Circumstance&quot; (Barlow, Weir) ? 5:39\n# &quot;Antwerp&amp;#039;s Placebo (The Plumber)&quot; (Hart, Kreutzmann) ? 0:39\n# &quot;Easy to Love You&quot; (Barlow, Mydland) ? 3:38\n# &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Ease Me In&quot; (traditional) ? 3:23\n\nGrateful Dead:\n\n    * Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n    * Bob Weir - guitar, vocals\n    * Brent Mydland - keyboards, vocals\n    * Phil Lesh - bass\n    * Bill Kreutzmann - drums\n    * Mickey Hart - drum","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0188cc3ad19b2cc88b9a1cb229ce58c46e664b0f","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead%2F+Go+To+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0188cc3ad19b2cc88b9a1cb229ce58c46e664b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,136,204,58,209,155,44,200,139,154,28,178,41,206,88,196,110,102,75,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
