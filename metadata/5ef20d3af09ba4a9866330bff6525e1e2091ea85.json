This cap is complete.  And it's encoded at the best quality possible, at 1080p.  This file has been tested and plays perfect. If it doesn't work for you, then your equipment cannot play 1080p.\n\nVERY SPECIAL thanks to Reb for the file. \n\nAnd a special F**K OFF to users like 'CyndiLauperNow' who continue to take the files and claim them as his/her own work.  I am all for sharing, but give credit where credit is due.  Reb made this file, not you.\n\nShare this file anywhere you want. But please don't rename it. \n\n\nFile              : Cyndi.Lauper.Still.So.Unusual.S01E06.Dinner.For.One.1080p.HDTV.x264-WETV.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 6 721 Kbps\nLength            : 1.01 GiB for 21mn 30s 215ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 595 Kbps\nAspect            : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ef20d3af09ba4a9866330bff6525e1e2091ea85","amp;dn":"Cyndi.Lauper.Still.So.Unusual.S01E06.Dinner.For.One.1080p.HDTV.x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ef20d3af09ba4a9866330bff6525e1e2091ea85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,242,13,58,240,155,164,169,134,99,48,191,246,82,94,30,32,145,234,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
