'Summer Bass Essentials Volume 1' features 31 monumental tracks from artists such as Rameses B, Safra &amp; Benzion, EH!DE, Slangor, Haris Pilton, The Catalysts, Nameless &amp; Flow Zen to name just a few. Each track on this album has been hand picked for their energetic, bright, summer sound and is the perfect play list for these warm summer evenings. Huge, twisted synth's proliferate through these tracks as do the crisp, pounding drums that are perfect for big outdoor spaces. Bass lines so deep and drops so huge parachutes should be issued to all listeners. Not a single track on here is a filler, every single tune is an absolute classic in its genre. If you are looking for an album to get your party rocking, and an album that will be the soundtrack to these warm months, this is it.
