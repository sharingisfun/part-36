There is, however, another side of Nashville, and that is \nwhere the likes of Kieran Kane and Kevin Welch live. Here music has roots \nand meaning, and both are abundantly in evidence in You Can&amp;#039;t Save \nEverbody.\n\nThis isn&amp;#039;t country music so much as the kind of folk sound shaped by Woody \nGuthrie in the 1940s and refined in the 1960s by the likes of Bob Dylan. I&amp;#039;m \nsure Dylan would approve of Kane and Welch if he&amp;#039;s heard them. The songs, \nthough clearly modern, incorporate rural and traditional points of reference. \nLike the great authentic folk songs, they speak directly to life&amp;#039;s most \nelemental concerns: faith, fear, hope, love, death, rage, and landscapes \nboth natural and psychic.\n\nThese guys are too good to let any mediocre tunes mar the pleasure. Every \nsong seems bound to grow on you with each successive listening. Three \nstand out immediately, at least for me. One is Kane&amp;#039;s instrumental &quot;Cecil&amp;#039;s \nLament,&quot; which sounds like an old Irish fiddle tune that long ago found its way \nto the Southern mountains. Anybody -- in this case Welch -- who would write \na ballad titled &quot;Jersey Devil&quot; (concerning a genuine Garden State legend \nabout a demonic winged creature) has my automatic approval. And if you \nlament the state of the nation, you will take to heart Welch&amp;#039;s &quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s \nWorking for the Man Again&quot; and hasten to spread the message to your \nfriends. &quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s Working&quot; demonstrates that if the current state of the \nnation is good for nothing else, at least it has done wonders for the \nold-fashioned folk protest song. This is one biting, satisfying example.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f75ea097f1bb01ec3e9d24ac7e313fce35865bf2","amp;dn":"Kevin+Welch%2C+Kieran+Kane+%26+Fats+Kaplin-You+Can%5C%27t+Save+Everybo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f75ea097f1bb01ec3e9d24ac7e313fce35865bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,94,160,151,241,187,1,236,62,157,36,172,126,49,63,206,53,134,91,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
