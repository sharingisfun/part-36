This was accompanied by a bass-voiced continuity announcer in the style of that era. Viewers in Wales saw an original 'BBC Cymru Wales' mechanical globe with introductions provided by former BBC Wales announcers. Trailers for the show also used the 1970s style, including the rhombus-style BBC logo.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a072d50ed979e4630d06c05f34f31a634b4525","amp;dn":"Life+on+Mars-+Series+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60a072d50ed979e4630d06c05f34f31a634b4525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,160,114,213,14,217,121,228,99,13,6,192,95,52,243,26,99,75,69,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
