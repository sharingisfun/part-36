At first an exciting adventure, Guy Sajer's war becomes, as the German invasion falters in the icy vastness of the Ukraine, a simple, desperate struggle for survival against cold, hunger, and above all, the terrifying Soviet artillery. As a member of the elite Gross Deutschland division, he fought in all the great battles, from Kursk to Kharkov. Sajer's German footsoldier's perspective makes THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER a unique war memoir, the book that The Christian Science Monitor said &quot;may well be the book about World War II that has been so long awaited.&quot; Now it has been handsomely republished as a hardcover containing fifty rare German combat photos of life and death at the Eastern Front. The photos of troops battling through snow, mud, burned villages, and rubble strewn cities depict the hardships and destructiveness of war. Many are originally from the private collections of German soldiers and have never before been published. This is a deluxe edition of a true classic. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Forgotten-Soldier-Guy-Sajer/dp/1574882864/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1284660949&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Forgotten-Soldier-Guy-Sajer/dp/1574882864/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1284660949&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54624d0e361b413710dda7a766a3edff272b54f","amp;dn":"The+Forgotten+Soldier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54624d0e361b413710dda7a766a3edff272b54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,70,36,208,227,97,180,19,113,13,218,122,118,106,62,223,242,114,181,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
