And, in the pouring rain, amid the mud and shattered trees of a rubber plantation called Long Tan, with their ammunition running out and a Vietnamese battalion massing for the final assault, the digger\\&amp;#039;s situation seems hopeless. With casualties mounting, can the six young Australian commanders and their men hold out until the relief force arrives?\n\nToday, the dynamics of this historic battle is taught to new army recruits as the ideal example of how to handle a hostile situation in conflict.\n\nAn absorbing, well-researched and unusual account of the battle of Long Tan, told by both Viet Cong and Australian survivors of the battle with archival film, details the cat-and-mouse intelligence and counter-intelligence moves by both sides before the battle.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5244f81f7cfc4faee160be2335b3392fa7ae4197","amp;dn":"Long.Tan.The.True.Story%5B2006%5DDVDRIP.XVID%5BEng%5D-Bearmeister.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5244f81f7cfc4faee160be2335b3392fa7ae4197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,68,248,31,124,252,79,174,225,96,190,35,53,179,57,47,167,174,65,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
