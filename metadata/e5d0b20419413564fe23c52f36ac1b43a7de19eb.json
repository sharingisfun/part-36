As a last resort, Queen Anne summons the heirs of the original Musketeers to her aid...including Claire, daughter of Athos, who when she chooses can miraculously pass as a boy, and wields as fine a sword as any. All their skills will be needed for a battle against increasing odds. One for all and all for one!\n\nCornel Wilde ... D'Artagnan Jr.\nMaureen O'Hara ... Claire - daughter of Athos\nRobert Douglas ... Duc de Lavalle\nGladys Cooper ... Queen Anne\nJune Clayworth ... Comtesse Claudine\nDan O'Herlihy ... Aramis Jr.\nAlan Hale Jr. ... Porthos Jr.\n\nDirected by Lewis Allen\n\n\nThis is a special one -- not exactly a pirate movie, but definitely high adventure! Another special thing about this is that it was taken from a Master tape, used for broadcasting.\n\nAlso, it may be old news, but I heard this afternoon that 20th Century Fox closed it's department dedicated to releasing their old films on DVD and stopped all restorations. So, if you enjoy these ripping adventures, PLEASE go out and buy the DVD!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5d0b20419413564fe23c52f36ac1b43a7de19eb","amp;dn":"%5BClassic+Adventure%5D+At+Sword%5C%27s+Point+%281952%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5d0b20419413564fe23c52f36ac1b43a7de19eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,208,178,4,25,65,53,100,254,35,197,47,54,172,27,67,167,222,25,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
