Select Cuts from Blood and Fire is the ultimate remix compilation of new-school DJs remixing the great dub of the past. If you are a reggae and or dub fan then this cd is a must. On this cd you will hear the great roots rock vocals like that of Cedrick Myton of the congos, Horrace Andy and Yabby You over FAT beats spanning new-school generas from trip-hop to jungle to house/trance. The best thing is that for the most part the DJs did not destroy old classics but were very discerning and only made the dub Fatter and more jucy. I can't wait for blood and fire to do a project like this again. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n1. Youth Of Today (Kaleidoscope - Rmx) - Horace Andy \n2.
