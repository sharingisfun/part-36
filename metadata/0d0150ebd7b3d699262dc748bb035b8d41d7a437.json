Produced by Bill Randle, it was Kerouac's most musical performance, despite the fact that the recording contained only his voice and no accompaniment, using his voice and language the way a saxophonist might improvise on a particular melodic line or riff. He's spellbinding throughout, intense, focused, and even subtly changing voices with the work itself.\n\nReadings by Jack Kerouac on the Beat Generation was nominated for the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. San Francisco Scene (3:09)\n2. Medley: San Francisco Blues (Fragments) (3:02)\n3. Lucien Midnight: The Sounds Of The Universe In My Window (4:22)\n4. History Of Bop (10:53)\n5. The Subterraneans (3:07)\n6.
