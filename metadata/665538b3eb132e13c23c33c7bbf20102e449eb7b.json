Up until now there was no crack for roboform that included the adapter that worked in the new firefox 3.6.1\n\nDownload and follow the instructions in the text file.\n\nAgain, I did not create the roboform.dll crack, just the custom xpi file for firefox.\n\nBasically you need to install roboform, crack it, and then run firefox and install the add-on I've supplied.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[kingbear]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665538b3eb132e13c23c33c7bbf20102e449eb7b","amp;dn":"Roboform+7.1.0+Enterprise+-+Firefox+3.6.1+%5Bkingbear%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665538b3eb132e13c23c33c7bbf20102e449eb7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,85,56,179,235,19,46,19,194,60,51,199,187,242,1,2,228,73,235,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
