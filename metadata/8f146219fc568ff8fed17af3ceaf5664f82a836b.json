It is silent and has multiple uses. It is powerful and has better range than a bow. It is accurate and easy to learn to use. It is easily improvised and highly portable. It can be readily concealed. Ammunition is available anywhere for free and it is inexpensive, and takes up little room. This is the complete manual on this little-known weapon. It tells how to make one, how to use one, and when and where to use one. Six different techniques are described and illustrated in detail. Also included is advice on how and where to practice, descriptions of ammunition, and practical applications. Highly recommended for all survivalists and weapons enthusiasts.\n\nUploaders Note: i have converted this book from a PDF file to Kindle format. i hope you enjoy the quality. if there are any problems please leave a comment. i have tested this file with Kindle for PC and kindle handheld.\n\nPlease seed and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f146219fc568ff8fed17af3ceaf5664f82a836b","amp;dn":"The+Sling%3A+For+Sport+and+Survival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f146219fc568ff8fed17af3ceaf5664f82a836b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,20,98,25,252,86,143,248,254,209,122,243,206,175,86,100,248,42,131,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
