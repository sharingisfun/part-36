What would happen now, if you started to change your thinking only to the positive...? Would you be more or less successful...? Do you know someone who is negative...if you changed your thinking right now, how long would it be before that person adopted a similar way of thinking, or even better, adopted a positive thinking strategy similar to yours?&quot; Benjamin Bonetti's self-help tools have changed the lives of thousands of people around the world, offering simple solutions for lasting change.
