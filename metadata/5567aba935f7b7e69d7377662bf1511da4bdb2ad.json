I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know\n Just listenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the one that I want, the one that I need\n The one that I gotta have just to succeed\n When I first saw you, I knew it was real\n IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry about the pain I made you feel\n\n That wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t me; let me show you the way\n I looked for the sun, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raining today\n I remember when I first looked into your eyes\n It was like God was there, heaven in the skies\n\n\n thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5567aba935f7b7e69d7377662bf1511da4bdb2ad","amp;dn":"You+Were+My+Everything+by+Aviation+MP3+uploaded+by+Ashes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5567aba935f7b7e69d7377662bf1511da4bdb2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,103,171,169,53,247,183,230,157,115,119,102,43,241,81,29,164,189,178,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
