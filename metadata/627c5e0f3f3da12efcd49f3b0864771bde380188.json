It begins with a dream that just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quit, the once-in-a-lifetime thunderbolt of pure inspiration, the obsession, the world-beater, the killer app, the next big thing. Everyone who wants to make the world a better place becomes possessed by a grand idea.\nBut what does it take to turn your idea into action?  Whether you are an entrepreneur, intrapreneur, or not-for-profit crusader, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no shortage of advice available on issues such as writing a business plan, recruiting, raising capital, and branding. In fact, there are so many books, articles, and Web sites that many startups get bogged down to the point of paralysis. Or else they focus on the wrong priorities and go broke before they discover their mistakes. In The Art of the Start, Guy Kawasaki brings two decades of experience as one of businessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most original and irreverent strategists to offer the essential guide for anyone starting anything, from a multinational corporation to a church group. At Apple in the 1980s, he helped lead one of the great companies of the century, turning ordinary consumers into evangelists. As founder and CEO of Garage Technology Ventures, a venture capital firm, he has field-tested his ideas with dozens of newly hatched companies. And as the author of bestselling business books and articles, he has advised thousands of people who are making their startup dreams real. From raising money to hiring the right people, from defining your positioning to creating a brand, from creating buzz to buzzing the competition, from managing a board to fostering a community, this book will guide you through an adventure thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more art than scienceÃ¢â‚¬â€the art of the start.\n(less)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:627c5e0f3f3da12efcd49f3b0864771bde380188","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+the+Start","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"627c5e0f3f3da12efcd49f3b0864771bde380188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,124,94,15,63,61,161,46,252,212,159,59,8,100,119,27,222,56,1,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
