Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»Oh yeah, Muddy is a real singer of the BluesÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â«, Big Bill, that Mississippi foundation stone, was heard to say early on in Muddy WatersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ career, although the sound of the man 15 years his junior could be likened to new shoots coming out of the gnarled root named the Blues.\nFull of confidence after a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest OfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ compilation released on the Chess label in 1959 and his legendary appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, Muddy set down his own Broonzy songs. It goes almost without saying that such successful numbers as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Feel So GoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTell Me BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ are overflowing with a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Chicago feelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ which gets right under your skin. Pulsating with the metallic heartbeat of the electric guitar and the gyrating licks which James Cotton conjures out of his harmonica, the cover title amalgamates the individual styles of two top-notch Blues musicians to produce a highly emotional mixture. And letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not forget the band formed around keyboarder Otis Spann, their fellow musician of many yearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ standing. Just listen carefully to this small but excellent ensemble and you will certainly forget the banal term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“rhythm groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“!\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Tell Me Baby (2:16)\n2.
