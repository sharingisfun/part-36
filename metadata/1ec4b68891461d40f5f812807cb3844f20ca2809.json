Outta This World, is JLS's aptly titled second album. Working with a roll call of international pop-R&amp;B production talent--whose collective CVs include the likes of Rihanna, Ne-Yo, and the Black Eyed Peas--Aston, Marvin, OritsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and JB have crafted 14 killer tracks ranging from heart-pumping techno-laced stompers to tender acoustic balladry. Co-writing the majority of the tracks, the guys display the full range of their talents from the smooth close harmonies of &quot;Other Side Of The World&quot; (with the lads sharing love-struck lead vocals) to kinetic future pop like the take-no-prisoners floor filler &quot;Superhero&quot;.\nWorking with Stargate (the force behind monster hits for BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Flo Rida and more) has produced some of the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stand-out tracks; the frankly brilliant title track &quot;Outta This World&quot;--a muscular electro-fuelled heavy hitter, anthemic Children In Need charity single &quot;Love You More&quot; and band favourite &quot;Love At War&quot;. The number one single from the summer &quot;The Club Is Alive&quot; is also included\n\n01. The Club Is Alive\n02. Eyes Wide Shut\n03. Outta This World\n04. That's My Girl\n05. Work\n06.
