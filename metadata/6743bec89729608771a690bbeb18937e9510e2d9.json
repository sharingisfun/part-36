Highlighting the uniqueness of their styles and personalities Gloria became a classic in the field. Produced along the same lines the Symfora Tapes show seven leading contemporary therapists, representing major frames of refenrence, viz. Salman Akhtar, Arthur Freeman, Otto Kernberg, Marsha Linehan, Lawrence Rockland,Lorna Smith Benjamin and Micheal Stone. They all conduct a first interview with the same patient, who is Alfred Koops, a middle-aged man suffering from personality disorder.\n\nLike Gloria, the Symfora Tapes offer a unique opportunity to observe master clinicians at work, and enjoy their skill. You will see at first hand how different schools use different strategies, how they apply different techniques. Equally interesting, you will be able to watch them acting in the same way, applying the rules of contemporary psychotherapy. The approaches shown are: cognitive-behavioral variations: interpersonal psychotherapy and transference focused-, supportive-, and integrated forms of  psychodynamic psychotherapy.\n\nThe character of Alfred Koops is portrayed by Hendrik Grashuis, a leading Dutch actor in this field. The actor was not using set lines and you will see him improvising on the basis of the information he received from the producers on the dynamics of the character. The only thing all clinicians knew was that an actor would be playing the part of the patient. They did not know the actor, nor were they given any information about the case being portrayed.\n\nThe Symfora Tapes were produced by Hendrik-Jan Dalewijk and Bert van Luijn as part of a series of workshops on personality disorders and the series was organized by Psychiatry in Progress, a program for postgraduate education in psychiatry and psychotherapy from the Symfora groep, a group of psychiatric and mental health services in the Netherlands.\n\nContains:\nCompressed videos of the 7 original DVDs.\nScanned full-color images of the booklet and box and enhanced black-and-white pictures of the therapists.\n\nSpecs:\nContainer: Matroska\nVideo codec: H.264/MPEG-4\nBitrate: 1000 kbit/s\nResolution: 720x576\nMovie aspect: 1.33:1\nFrame rate: 25 fps\nAudio Codec: AAC/MPEG-4\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nChannels: stereo format s16le\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6743bec89729608771a690bbeb18937e9510e2d9","amp;dn":"symfora+tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6743bec89729608771a690bbeb18937e9510e2d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,67,190,200,151,41,96,135,113,166,144,187,235,24,147,126,149,16,226,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
