Fortunately, it is a very good one, displaying its leader's love for hard-swinging and exciting performances. The featured sidemen include trombonist Frank Lacy, trumpeters Irv Stokes and Jon Faddis, clarinetist Rudy Rutherford and pianist Richard Wyands, but the great tenor's solos and the exuberant sound of the ensembles are most notable. With arrangements by Wild Bill Davis, Eddie Barefield and Phil Wilson, the highlights include &quot;Tickletoe,&quot; &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy&quot; and &quot;Three Buckets of Jive&quot;; in reality, all eight selections are rewarding.
