Covering all styles and genres, the authors, both noted film composers, cover everything from the nuts-and-bolts of timing, cuing, and recording through balancing the composer's aesthetic vision with the needs of the film itself. Unlike other books that are aimed at the person &quot;dreaming&quot; of a career, this is truly a guide that can be used by everyone from students to technically sophisticated professionals. It contains over 100 interviews with noted composers, illustrating the many technical points made through the text.\n\nPublication Date: January 10, 2004 | ISBN-10: 0415941369 | ISBN-13: 978-0415941365 | Edition: 2\n\nOn the Track: A Guide to Contemporary Film Scoring","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e37935509c287be91be0a802d0fac9d3ee96b2","amp;dn":"On+the+Track%3A+A+Guide+to+Contemporary+Film+Scoring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e37935509c287be91be0a802d0fac9d3ee96b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,227,121,53,80,156,40,123,233,27,224,168,2,208,250,201,211,238,150,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
