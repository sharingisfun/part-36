They were originally established with American rock band Elf's members, but Blackmore fired all the members except Ronnie James Dio who would leave in 1979. Three British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neoclassical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide and 4 million albums in the United States.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn Stage is a double live album originally released by the British hard rock band Rainbow in 1977. It was recorded live over several German and Japanese dates in late 1976 during the Rising world tour.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRainbow:\n\nRitchie Blackmore: guitar\nRonnie James Dio: vocals\nTony Carey: keyboards, Orchestron\nJimmy Bain: bass\nCozy Powell: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98fc5178a361a5315d24146d505b1d67ecc1ca0","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+On+Stage+%5B1977%5D%5B2008%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BJPN%5D%5BSHM-CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98fc5178a361a5315d24146d505b1d67ecc1ca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,143,197,23,138,54,26,83,21,210,65,70,213,5,177,214,126,204,28,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
