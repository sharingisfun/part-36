After the initial furore of questioning suspects and analyzing motives has died down, investigators are often left with no leads, and the uneasy knowledge that a dangerous person is still on the loose, possibly preparing to strike again.\r\n\r\nBut there is hope. With the development of science, and the continuing improvements in detection techniques, the re-examination of old, unsolved crimes is yielding positive results, often decades after the cases originally went 'cold'. This book documents the most fascinating of these cases, and includes:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ The murdered heiress, Helen Brach\r\nâ€¢ Albert Fish, child killer\r\nâ€¢ The Green River killer, Gary Leon Ridgway\r\nâ€¢ Gerald Parker, the 'Bedroom Basher'\r\nâ€¢ The woman in a box\r\nâ€¢ The bone breaker, Joe Clark\r\nâ€¢ Frank Bender, forensic sculptor\r\nâ€¢ Dennis Rader, the 'Bind, Torture, Kill' killer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9dcf40baef614491f89a19a492e738803f507b","amp;dn":"Criminal+Cold+Cases+%282011%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9dcf40baef614491f89a19a492e738803f507b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,157,207,64,186,239,97,68,145,248,154,25,164,146,231,56,128,63,80,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
