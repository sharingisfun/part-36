However, with most chemical engineering application problems having many variables with complex inter-relationships, meeting these optimization objectives can be challenging. This is where Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is useful to find the optimal trade-offs among two or more conflicting objectives.\n\nThis book provides an overview of the recent developments and applications of MOO for modeling, design and operation of chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, energy and related processes. It then covers important theoretical and computational developments as well as specific applications such as metabolic reaction networks, chromatographic systems, CO2 emissions targeting for petroleum refining units, ecodesign of chemical processes, ethanol purification and cumene process design.\n\nMulti-Objective Optimization in Chemical Engineering: Developments and Applications is an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students in chemical engineering as well as industrial practitioners and engineers involved in process design, modeling and optimization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e34ffc6889de1e00d70e3a941741b77e7aa5e294","amp;dn":"Multi-Objective+Optimization+in+Chemical+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e34ffc6889de1e00d70e3a941741b77e7aa5e294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,79,252,104,137,222,30,0,215,14,58,148,23,65,183,126,122,165,226,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
