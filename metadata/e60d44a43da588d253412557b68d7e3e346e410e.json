You take the role of Sakuri, a 15 years old girl that is victim of bullying at school, until she decides to take revenge and attempts to summon demons to help her. Once she goes sleeping, she awakes at Hell, and therefore your mission is to help her escape from there. This game is well known because it depicts many different deaths to the poor girl, all of them full of gore and who knows what else. \n\nThere's a torrent for this game already submitted, but it's a ZIP containing the game, a readme and the source code. This one, instead, is a folder containing the game and that readme file only, which I find myself much comfortable to seed and keep in the HDD at the same time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e60d44a43da588d253412557b68d7e3e346e410e","amp;dn":"DEMONOPHOBIA+%28English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e60d44a43da588d253412557b68d7e3e346e410e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,13,68,164,61,165,136,210,83,65,37,87,182,141,126,62,52,110,65,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
