Vinz, a Jew, SaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯d, an Arab, and Hubert, a black boxer, have grown up in these French suburbs where high levels of diversity coupled with the racist and oppressive police force have raised tensions to a critical breaking point. During the riots that took place a night before, a police officer lost his handgun in the ensuing madness, only to leave it for Vinz to find. Now, with a newfound means to gain the respect he deserves, Vinz vows to kill a cop if his friend Abdel dies in the hospital, due the beating he received while in police custody\n--IMDB\n\nAudio: French/Hungarian\nSubs: Hun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75c13fac3cddc1100133c5a1fb9f1338164a05a9","amp;dn":"La+Haine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75c13fac3cddc1100133c5a1fb9f1338164a05a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,193,63,172,60,221,193,16,1,51,197,161,251,159,19,56,22,74,5,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
