And it looked like she could cross over into a relative state of superstardom when she released her eponymous debut album in 2007, especially when a certain Bob Dylan popped up to express his admiration of the singer. Said Ethan Johns-produced set also found a fan in Laura Marling, who subsequently recruited the Brit Award nominee to work on her acclaimed I Speak Because I Can. However, things started to go awry, TucekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life taking a turn for the worse.\nFor her second album Tucek elucidates these tribulations, chiefly those connected to her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, and explores related themes throughout the collection. It features moments of true beguilement, and referencing the greats ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a bit of Feist here, Throwing Muses there, along with touches of Karen Dalton, Cat Power and Linda Perhacs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ together with a musical menu of Neil Young, The Velvet Underground and even a dash of Big Star, helps to make Get Well Soon a marvel. It proves that through the hard times comes sweetness of a kind, a resolving of the personal Hell that is the loss of a parent. Despite its sombre influences, though, this is an earthy and oddly life-enhancing listen.\n\nOpening with the delicate The Wound and the Bow, second track Wooden sets up the album properly as it bursts into life from gentle beginnings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ come its end, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exuded a pre-concept-addled Pink Floyd rock-out warmth. State I Am In broods Breeders-like into classic Sister Lovers territory, while The Fireman is especially pleasing, Tucek recounting with touching detail a dream she had about her father: &quot;The fireman saved many a home / But the fireman could not save his own.&quot; The closing title-track allows her to put some distance between so much grief ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the dislocation, pleading and real lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s butting in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and where she is today. It wraps up what must have been a dreadful couple of years, and bookends this collection perfectly.\n\nThere are around 20,000 records like this released every year by female troubadours. But thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something just very right, and really quite splendid, about Get Well Soon. It could well prove to be a timeless little wonder.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/05/17/sarabeth-tucek/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/05/17/sarabeth-tucek/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:724480ef4bf996702eb833761ee36a38c923566e","amp;dn":"Sarabeth+Tucek...Get+Well+Soon%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"724480ef4bf996702eb833761ee36a38c923566e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,68,128,239,75,249,150,112,46,184,51,118,30,227,106,56,201,35,86,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
