What if you could turn opposition and resistance into agreement and support for liberty? What if you could melt people's indifference and apathy toward freedom? What if you could develop a Midas Touch for liberty -- transforming person after person into libertarians?\r\n\r\nSecrets of Libertarian Persuasion can help make this happen!\r\n\r\nPure Gold\r\n\r\nLibertarianism is 24-carat pure gold. But most of the time we can't even give it way.\r\n\r\nWhy? Why isn't everyone desperately seeking freedom? Why are so many people indifferent? Why are many others opposed to liberty? And why have so many people just given up? Because no one has opened their eyes to the possibility of liberty. No one has touched their hearts with the intense desirability of liberty. No one has reached their minds with the principled and practical wisdom of liberty.\r\n\r\nSecrets of Libertarian Persuasion solves these problems. Secrets of Libertarian Persuasion gives you the keys to opening people's hearts and minds to liberty.\r\n\r\nWhat You'll Learn:\r\n\r\n-- Why libertarians don't need &quot;A Better Mousetrap.&quot; (p.23)\r\n-- What libertarians can learn from Mark Twain's Cat.

(p.63)\r\n-- Get people to &quot;Push the Button&quot; and become libertarians. (p.81)\r\n-- Treasure Map for finding people who urgently want freedom. (p.83)\r\n-- One deadly mistake almost every libertarian makes -- and how to avoid it. (p.96)\r\n-- &quot;You know enough about libertarianism to buy it, but do you know enough to sell it?&quot; (p.126)\r\n-- When to &quot;Save Your Breath.&quot; (p.165)\r\n-- The Biggest Libertarian Communication Turnoff. (p.171)\r\n-- How to handle &quot;The Toughest Prospects: Family and Friends.&quot; (p.185)\r\n-- Danger: &quot;Counterfeit Libertarianism.&quot; (p.210)\r\n-- &quot;The Unsettling Question Libertarians Almost Never Ask.&quot; (p.236)\r\n\r\nAnd much more!\r\n\r\nIs This For You?\r\n\r\nIf you talk about libertarianism with your family, friends, co-workers, or neighbors, you will start seeing astonishing differences almost immediately.
