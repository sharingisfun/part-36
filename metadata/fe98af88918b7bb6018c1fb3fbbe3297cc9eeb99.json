(A starter list of word families and words\nappears on pages 7 and 8.) Word families are by nature playful,\nmaking games the perfect approach for teaching them. By\npresenting this area of instruction in a playful way, you can\nreinforce the idea that learning to read can be full of fun. Some of\nthe games, such as Ug, Ug, Bug! (see page 10), reinforce word\nfamilies through twists on traditional games. Other games, such as\nBack to the Beehive (see page 23), come with reproducible activity\nsheets for reinforcing the skill. There are quiet games, such as\nShake a Sound (see page 14), that children can play at their desks\nindependently or with partners, and more active group games, such\nas Beach-Ball Word Builders (see page 9). The assortment of games\nmakes it easy for you to vary the way students learn about word\nfamilies, keeping their interest high as they strengthen reading\nskills.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe98af88918b7bb6018c1fb3fbbe3297cc9eeb99","amp;dn":"30+Wonderful+Word+Family+Games.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe98af88918b7bb6018c1fb3fbbe3297cc9eeb99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,152,175,136,145,139,123,182,1,140,31,179,251,190,50,151,204,158,235,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
