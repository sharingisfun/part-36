There are many bad actors on the international stage capable of cyber terror on a massive scale. The list is long, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Syria and now even terrorist groups like ISIS. Each is capable of wreaking havoc in the US by shutting down our power grid and enjoying the resulting chaos.\r\n\r\nCyber Warfare is a primer on the threats we face as a nation from the bad actors mentioned above. It explores the history of cyber attacks, and discusses the nuances of the terminology. The policies of the United States, and its allies, have evolved over the past decade. The problem of attribution is explored as cyber space allows hackers a convenient place to hide.\r\n\r\nThe all important issue is raised:\r\n\r\nWhen does a cyber attack become an act of war?\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough review of the threat a Cyber War poses for America, in particular on the nation's critical infrastructure, Cyber Warfare will provide preparedness solutions. This guide will also help you answer the question:\r\n\r\nWhat if the preppers are right?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5cfe09e3e7d78606d04943a088d703b2a000fcc","amp;dn":"Cyber+Warfare+-+Prepping+for+Tomorrow+%5BVolume+1%5D+%28ePUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5cfe09e3e7d78606d04943a088d703b2a000fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,207,224,158,62,125,120,96,109,4,148,58,8,141,112,59,42,0,15,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
