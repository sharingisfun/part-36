The long-awaited follow-up to its breakthrough album, 2009's Manners, finds the band spinning shimmering silk from many intricately layered threads: airy synths, warm bass, crisp snares, crashing cymbals, singer Michael Angelakos' expressive falsetto. Each song positively glows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa6f64f3ae7ea0edafc4c06e91b9a1f1d225fee","amp;dn":"Passion+Pit+-+Gossamer+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa6f64f3ae7ea0edafc4c06e91b9a1f1d225fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,166,246,79,58,231,234,14,218,252,76,6,233,27,154,31,29,34,95,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
