They are best remembered for the hit \\&quot;The Warrior\\&quot; from 1984 which was written by Nick Gilder and Holly Knight.\n\nThis CD was released as part of VH-1\\'s \\&quot;We Are The 80s\\&quot; series. This proved to be a very interesting release for Scandal fans, as it is more than just an average compilation for these reasons:\n\n1. The entire Scandal EP from 1982 is presented here on CD for the first time.Tracks 1, 2, 4, 5 &amp; 6 make up the EP in its original running order, unfortunately interrupted by \\&quot;The Warrior\\&quot; probably due to the CD producer wanting familiar songs up front.\n\n2. Also for the first time on CD, \\&quot;All My Life\\&quot; which was originally a B-Side to the \\&quot;Goodbye To You\\&quot; single.\n\n3. Tracks 12, 13 &amp; 14 are never before released from the EP recording sessions.\n\n4. The remaining tracks are from 1984\\'s \\&quot;The Warrior\\&quot; and include the hits \\&quot;The Warrior\\&quot;, \\&quot;Hands Tied\\&quot; and \\&quot;Beat Of A Heart\\&quot; from that album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:407d69311aadeada6b4193861ebe37d3451b2698","amp;dn":"Scandal+-+We+Are+The+80s+%282006%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"407d69311aadeada6b4193861ebe37d3451b2698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,125,105,49,26,173,234,218,107,65,147,134,30,190,55,211,69,27,38,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
