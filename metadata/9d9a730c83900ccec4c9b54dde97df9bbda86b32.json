Through Rainmeter, you can enhance your\nWindows computer at home or work with skins: handy, compact applets which float freely\non your desktop, much like Windows Sidebar gagdgets, or dashboard widgets for the Mac.\n\nRainmeter skins provide you with useful information at a glance. It's easy to keep an eye\non your system resources, like memory and battery power, or your online data streams,\nincluding email, RSS feeds, and weather forecasts. Many skins are even functional: they can\nrecord your notes and to-do lists, launch your favorite applications, and send your tweets to\nTwitter - all in a clean, unobtrusive interface that you can rearrange and customize to your liking.\n\nEvery inch of a skin is completely customizable. Rainmeter skins are written in a simple, elegant\nlanguage that's easy to learn for anyone who's willing to put in the effort. Skins call upon measures,\na set of powerful built-in modules that do all the heavy lifting, and create interactive meters to\ndisplay that information however you decide. In this way, Rainmeter brings productive innovation together\nwith creative artistry like no other platform of its kind.\n\nTo display temperatures, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need the free program ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpeedfanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.It is included in this torrent.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nUnrar with WinRAR or 7z.\n\nTo install a new skin just copy the selected folder in C:UsersYour NameMy DocumentsRainmeterSkins.\n\nTo install a new plugin just copy paste the(.dll)file in C:Program FilesRainmeterPlugins.\n\nJust right click on the rainmeter system tray icon and select refresh all to load new skins and plugins.\n\nTo select individual gadgets -&gt; right click on Rainmeter system tray icon -&gt; Configs -&gt; Skins -&gt; gadget(.ini)\n\nTo close a gadget -&gt; right click on the gadget -&gt; Skin Menu -&gt; Close Skin\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis torrent contains Rainmeter setup and some of the most popular Rainmeter skins.\n\nAll the content is safe and free of malware.\n\nIf you have any difficulty then post it and it will be answered as soon as possible.\n\nIf you liked this torrent then seed it as long as possible.\n\nPost comments on the torrent.\n\n\nThank You.\n\n\nAlphaR11\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d9a730c83900ccec4c9b54dde97df9bbda86b32","amp;dn":"Rainmeter+%5BAlphaR11%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d9a730c83900ccec4c9b54dde97df9bbda86b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,154,115,12,131,144,12,206,196,201,181,77,222,151,223,155,189,168,107,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
