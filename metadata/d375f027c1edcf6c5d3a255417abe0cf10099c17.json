We witness some of the key developments in plants that made possible the web of life - since evolved and now endangered. Brilliant use of micro, macro and time-lapse photography delivers stunning close-ups of special relationships between plants and animals: barnacles feeding, microscopic plankton, tiny grasses flowering, and pollinators at work. The interdependence between plants and animals is portrayed as an unwritten &quot;green&quot; contract. Five continents are covered as the jungle ecosystem is studied from insect-eating plants to the camouflage of insects themselves. The attempts to restore the balance of these ecosystems is also examined.\n\n\nClimb into the prickly jaws of insect-eating plants. Watch a flying fox gorge itself on a midnight snack of figs. Witness a mantis disguised as a flower petal lure its prey to doom. You&amp;#039;ll see the alarming destruction humankind has caused to our ecosystems and find hope in recent efforts to restore the natural balance we have disturbed. Narrated by Patrick Stewart.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: DivX 5.2.1\nVideo Bitrate: 2117 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 608x448\nVideo Aspect Ratio: ~4:3\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 224 kbps\nAudio Channels: 6\nRunTime Per Part: 42 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700 MB\nRipped by Xibalban\n\nwww mvgroup org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d375f027c1edcf6c5d3a255417abe0cf10099c17","amp;dn":"IMAX+The+Secret+of+Life+on+Earth+DivX+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d375f027c1edcf6c5d3a255417abe0cf10099c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,117,240,39,193,237,207,108,93,58,37,84,23,171,224,207,16,9,156,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
