I'm not really sure if I made it right or not. I hope I did, but if I didn't I'm sorry. There is no problem with me seeding it, because it's been on my computer for 2 years now and probably will be on there 2 more. I hope this torrent works, and I hope everyone enjoys this great series.\n\n\n*There are no texted languages.*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ef56d77b4fd10ac03073b962acf2daaed1fc29d","amp;dn":"Masters+of+Horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ef56d77b4fd10ac03073b962acf2daaed1fc29d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,245,109,119,180,253,16,172,3,7,59,150,42,207,45,170,237,31,194,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
