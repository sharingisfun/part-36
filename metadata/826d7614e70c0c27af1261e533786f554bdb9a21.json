The book circles around two life-changing moments. The assassination of her uncle Salvador Allende Gossens on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a literary writer. And the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on her adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth an overdue acknowledgment that Allende had indeed left home. My Invented Country, mimicking the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance between past and present lives. It speaks compellingly to immigrants and to all of us who try to retain a coherent inner life in a world full of contradictions.\nRead by Blair Brown\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n------------------------\nVisit us for more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826d7614e70c0c27af1261e533786f554bdb9a21","amp;dn":"My+Invented+Country%3A+A+Memoir+-+Isabel+Allende","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826d7614e70c0c27af1261e533786f554bdb9a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,109,118,20,231,12,12,39,175,18,97,229,51,120,111,85,75,219,154,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
