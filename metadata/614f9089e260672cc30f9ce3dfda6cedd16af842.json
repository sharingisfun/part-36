Both the band and Humphrey listened to the recordings, which numbered over 10,000 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ choosing the best and most fitting submission ideas to add to the songs final mix. In speaking about those who submitted their parts to the music, vocalist Tommy Lee said that:\n\n    &quot;There is a lot of undiscovered talent out there, from kids just getting started, to shirt tuckers who have a 9 to 5 that just rock out in a bar band on the weekends. They don't want to be famous, but those guys are stars.&quot;\n\nA music video for the single &quot;Time Bomb&quot; was released. The song has peaked at number 42 on the US Rock Songs Chart.\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Drunk Uncle Pete&quot;   \t2:45\n2. \t&quot;Time Bomb&quot;   \t3:23\n3. \t&quot;Louder&quot;   \t4:38\n4. \t&quot;Fight Song&quot;   \t3:57\n5. \t&quot;Blame&quot;   \t3:28\n6. \t&quot;2 Ways&quot;   \t3:56\n7. \t&quot;Talk Me Off the Ledge&quot;   \t2:46\n8. \t&quot;Only One&quot;   \t3:53\n9. \t&quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;   \t4:07\n10. \t&quot;Back to Before&quot;   \t5:25\n11. \t&quot;Party Instructions&quot;   \t4:50\n12. \t&quot;I Really Want You&quot; (Bonus track) \t3:40\n13. \t&quot;Let's Go&quot; (Bonus track) \t5:12\nPersonnel\n\nMethods of Mayhem\n\n    Tommy Lee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, drums\n    John &quot;J3&quot; Allen III Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\n    Will Hunt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\n    Scott Humphrey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ synthesizer, piano, backing vocals\n    DJ Aero Ã¢â‚¬â€œ turntables\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614f9089e260672cc30f9ce3dfda6cedd16af842","amp;dn":"Methods+Of+Mayhem+-+A+Public+Disservice+Announcement%28Special+Edi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614f9089e260672cc30f9ce3dfda6cedd16af842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,79,144,137,226,96,103,44,195,15,156,227,223,218,108,237,209,106,248,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
