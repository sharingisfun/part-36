After description of indications for imaging and the cross-sectional imaging anatomy of the area, subsequent chapters address the various diseases and conditions that affect the temporal bone and are likely to be encountered regularly in clinical practice. The classic imaging methods are described and discussed in detail, and individual chapters are included on newer techniques such as functional imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. There is also a strong focus on postoperative imaging. Throughout, imaging findings are documented with the aid of numerous informative, high-quality illustrations. Temporal Bone Imaging, with its straightforward structure based essentially on topography, will prove of immense value in daily practice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74ef72282c539cdd9d31349afc24f4d7b1b84a74","amp;dn":"Temporal+Bone+Imaging+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74ef72282c539cdd9d31349afc24f4d7b1b84a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,239,114,40,44,83,156,221,157,49,52,154,252,36,244,215,177,184,74,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
