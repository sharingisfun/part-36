Brought to you by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) South Africa. Play now and save the rhinos.\n\nRad keeps up a running charge against poachers and their arsenal of weapons. With the help of his trusted ally, Horn Bill, Rad has to dodge the flying hand grenades and automatic rifle fire; jump over exploding barrels... then thump the poachers as you chase after their getaway trucks and get one charge closer to Mr Big, kingpin behind the international rhino poaching syndicates.\n\nRad's adventure across the African savannah is punctuated by WWF's key insights into facts about rhinos and the truth behind the rhino poaching scourge. Rhino Raid aims to create awareness of WWF's rhino conservation projects in South Africa. It's fun, it's for good ...and it's RAD!\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Educational content\n- 9 Levels + 3 Boss battles\n- 3 Comic strips\n- Easy to learn one-touch gameplay\n- Jump to catch Horn Bill for a power-up\n- Share onand Twitter\n- WWF link to rhino information and donation \n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=za.co.flintsky.rhinoraid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=za.co.flintsky.rhinoraid&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce68372c8d63f1c2b1d247ee972fcd7f234eafd8","amp;dn":"WWF+Rhino+Raid+v1.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce68372c8d63f1c2b1d247ee972fcd7f234eafd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,104,55,44,141,99,241,194,177,210,71,238,151,47,205,127,35,78,175,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
