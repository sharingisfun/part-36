When approached about aiding Brown and his twenty recruits, Frederick Douglass adamantly refused, telling the zealot abolitionist that he was leading his men on a suicide mission. It did fail; all but a few of the anti-slavery &quot;soldiers&quot; were killed or captured; seven, including Brown, were executed. Even fellow abolitionists called the assault on the federal arsenal &quot;misguided, wild, and apparently insane,&quot; but as Tony Horwitz (Confederates in the Attic; A Voyage Long and Strange) demonstrates decisively in this new book, it served as the lightning strike that insured the election of Abraham Lincoln and soon thereafter ignited the Civil War. By presenting this wrong-headed attack in the context of its time, Horwitz shows that even small events can start momentous domino falls in history. A dramatic, extensively illustrated narrative.\n\nKevin Boyle\nHorwitz has given us a hard-driving narrative of one of America's most troubling historical figures: the fearsome John Brown, whose blood-soaked raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Va., in October 1859Ã¢â‚¬Â¦helped to push the nation into the most devastating war it would ever endure.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n\nProduct Details\nISBN-13: 9780312429263\nPublisher: Picador\nPublication date: 8/7/2012\nEdition description: Reprint\nPages: 384\n\nTable of Contents\nPrologue: October 16, 1859 1\n\nPart 1 The Road to Harper's Ferry\n\n1 School of Adversity 9\n2 I Consecrate My Life 20\n3 A Warlike Spirit 29\n4 First Blood 43\n5 Secret Service 60\n6 This Spark of Fire 80\n\nPart 2 Into Africa\n\n7 My Invisibles 97\n8 Into the Breach 127\n9 I Am Nearly Disposed of Now 173\n\nPart 3 They Will Brown Us All\n\n10 His Despised Poor 191\n11 A Full Fountain of Bedlam 220\n12 So Let It Be Done! 233\n13 Dissevering the Ties That Bind Us 258\nEpilogue: Immortal Raiders 272","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4dab249a5a7b5b438129608832f444c3e25fbdd","amp;dn":"Tony+Horwitz+-+Midnight+Rising+%28John+Brown+Raid%29+%5B96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4dab249a5a7b5b438129608832f444c3e25fbdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,218,178,73,165,167,181,180,56,18,150,8,131,47,68,76,62,37,251,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
