It captures the life and times of the greatest figure of the Protestant Reformation with depth and clarity, while giving a glimpse at the private man at the eye of the storm. Luther's protest against the established order of the Church opened up a debate that still goes on today and gave birth to one of the largest religious movements in history. One man's conscience truly changed the course of human events. \n\n Martin Luther is a film biography about the life and times of the greatest figure of the Protestant Reformation - Martin Luther, a 16th century German monk, priest, and theology professor's efforts to reform the Catholic church, his excommunication, and the developments that started the Protestant Reformation.\n\n Luther's observations and studies led him to be critical of the materialism of the Roman Catholic church; with its use of indulgences, relics and other wayward teachings and practices that are unsupported by the Bible (scripture) forced him to write and nail his 95 theses on the door of the Wittenberg church that was pivotal in leading a 'spiritual revolution' shaking the principalities of the Holy Roman Empire and the entirety of Medieval Europe that changed history forever.\n\n Martin Luther is directed by Irving Pichel and stars\n\n Niall MacGinnis as Martin Luther\n John Ruddock as Vicar Johann von Staupitz\n Pierre Lefevre as George Spalatin\n Guy Verney as Philipp Melanchthon\n Allastair Hunter as Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt\n David Horne as Elector Duke Frederick the Wise\n Fred Johnson as Prior of Erfurt monastery\n Philip Leaver as Pope Leo X\n Heinz Piper as Dr. John Eck\n Leonard White as brother and emissary of Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz\n Egon Strohm as Cardinal Aleander\n Annette Carrell as Katharina von Bora\n Alexander Gauge as Fr. John Tetzel\n Irving Pichel as Chancellor Brueck\n Hans Lefebre as Emperor Charles V\n John Wiggin as Narrator\n The music is composed by Mark Lothar and performed by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n A Louis DeRochemont film.\n\n This is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\n Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\n The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\n In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n &quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n &quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n More Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
