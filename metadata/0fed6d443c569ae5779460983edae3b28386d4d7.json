The film was directed by Michael Curtiz, and stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. It focuses on Rick&amp;#039;s conflict between, in the words of one character, love and virtue: he must choose between his love for Ilsa and his need to do the right thing by helping her husband, Resistance hero Victor Laszlo, escape from Casablanca and continue his fight against the Nazis.\n\nThe film was an immediate hit, and it has remained consistently popular ever since. Critics have praised the charismatic performances of Bogart and Bergman, the chemistry between the two leads, the depth of characterisation, the taut direction, the witty screenplay and the emotional impact of the work as a whole.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Casablanca_poster.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Casablanca_poster.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fed6d443c569ae5779460983edae3b28386d4d7","amp;dn":"Casablanca+%28dvd-rip%29+%5BENGLISH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fed6d443c569ae5779460983edae3b28386d4d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,237,109,68,60,86,154,229,119,148,96,152,62,218,227,178,131,134,212,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
