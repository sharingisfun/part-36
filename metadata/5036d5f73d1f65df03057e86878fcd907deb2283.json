The absent-minded Sarcophagus then realizes that the paper is not the Kih-Oskh papyrus he thought it was but some other negligible document. Sarcophagus believes that the papyrus will lead him to the undiscovered tomb of the Pharaoh Kih-Oskh and invites Tintin to accompany him. Tintin also has an unpleasant encounter with Roberto Rastapopoulos, a wealthy businessman.\n\nLater on the cruise Tintin first meets the Thompson twins, who arrest him over some cocaine which has been found in his cabin.\n\nLocked in the hold of the ship, Tintin craftily escapes and meets Sarcophagus in Port Said, Egypt. They set off and discover the tomb of Kih-Oskh. On a nearby sand dune Tintin finds a cigar bearing the symbol of Kih-Oskh ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ a circle with a wavy line through it and two dots on it, rather like a yin-yang symbol. But, when he returns to the tomb, Sarcophagus has disappeared.\n\nEntering the tomb, Tintin and Snowy are startled several times by doors closing behind them. They come to a room where rows of Egyptologists are mummified. At the end of the row are empty sarcophagi with notices to indicate that they are intended for Tintin, Snowy (and Sarcophagus in the later edition).\n\nFollowing items of Sarcophagus\\\\\\&amp;#039; clothing which have been left lying about, Tintin enters another room where drugged vapour puts him to sleep.\n\nThat night drug smugglers embark some sarcophagi aboard a ship but they are later cast overboard. The sarcophagi contain Tintin and Snowy who thus escape mummification. They are rescued from a gigantic wave by the crew of sailing ship. On it they meet Senhor Oliviera de Figueira, a Portuguese salesman who travels the Middle East selling to local Arabs. He somehow manages to persuade Tintin to buy all manner of utterly useless items. Tintin walks away overloaded with stuff, including a top hat, ski poles, a doghouse on wheels, and a lead for Snowy, accompanied by the thought \\\\\\&quot;Just as well I didn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t fall for his patter; you can end up with all sorts of useless stuff if you\\\\\\&amp;#039;re not careful\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nTintin then sets out across the desert and is captured by the men of Sheik Patrash Pasha. He hates Westerners but is then delightfully happy to learn that his captive is Tintin, whose exploits he has read of for years.\n\n(He is the only character to have read a Tintin book in the series. He also shows Tintin one of the books he has read, specifically the latest one to be published, which adds a little publicity: in the first B/W version, it was Tintin in the Congo; in the second, Tintin in America; and in the third, Destination Moon, an adventure that, chronologically, would not happen to Tintin for many years.)\n\nResuming his journey Tintin sees a woman being beaten by two men and rushes to her aid. The woman turns out to be an actress in a movie that Rastapopoulos is making. The director is furious but Rastapopoulos is much calmer. He and Tintin apologise to each other over the incidents on the cruise ship and the filming and become friends.\n\nWhen Tintin returns to the boat, he discovers that it has been smuggling guns. There is a lengthy comic sequence involving the Thompson twins who accuse him of being the smuggler. They hurry off when they think a grenade is due to explode, enabling Tintin to get away.\n\nIn Arabia, Tintin is walking in the desert when his water bottle is shot at and pierced by an unknown gunman. Desperate for water he sets off only to meet Thomson &amp; Thompson who give chase. Later they hit an Arab on the head, mistaking him for Tintin. When Tintin reaches a local city he finds a procession of armed Arabs who claim that one of their sheiks was attacked by two members of a rival tribe, thus providing a pretext for war. Tintin is enlisted by force into the army.\n\nWhile cleaning the colonel\\\\\\&amp;#039;s office, he finds a cigar label with Kih-Oskh\\\\\\&amp;#039;s sign. He searches the office for a box of cigars hoping that they will provide a clue but is caught in the act by the colonel and charged with spying. He is executed by firing squad, but does not actually die: the firing squad\\\\\\&amp;#039;s rifles had been loaded with blanks. Placed in a ventilated grave, Tintin is later dug up by a pair of mysterious allies. These \\\\\\&amp;#039;allies\\\\\\&amp;#039; are actually Thomson &amp; Thompson again, who were determined to capture him alive and arranged for his death to be faked.\n\nTintin flees the city in a military airplane pursued by others. To save himself he takes a dive and lands in India. There Tintin finds Sarcophagus who is painting the sign of Kih-Oskh on the trees. He has gone completely mad and thinks that he is another Pharaoh, Ramesses II.\n\nTintin and Sarcophagus are taken by elephant to a local outpost of Westerners. Later, Sarcophagus escapes and tries to kill Tintin with a knife. He was hypnotised by a local Fakir who wants Tintin dead. Some remarks by the Fakir lead Tintin to Zloty, a writer, who explains that an international gang of drug smugglers is out to dispose of Tintin. At gunpoint, Tintin orders Zloty to give him the name of the gang\\\\\\&amp;#039;s leader but, before he can, the Fakir, from outside the window, blows a dart at Zloty. Zloty goes mad because the dart was tipped with Rajaijah juice, the poison-of-madness.\n\nTintin takes Sarcophagus and Zloty to the asylum with a letter from a local doctor, but the Fakir has substituted the letter and Tintin ends up imprisoned. He escapes by jumping on an obese inmate and over the wall. Later Snowy is almost sacrificed by angry Indians for frightening their holy cow. The little dog is saved by Thomson &amp; Thompson, acting as the Nataraja. They then use Snowy to track down his master, whom they are still determined to put in jail.\n\nTintin\\\\\\&amp;#039;s escape from the asylum is reported and he is re-captured. While he is being driven back by ambulance, it crashes into the car driven by Sarcophagus and Zloty. Tintin escapes and later meets the Maharaja of Gaipajama. Over dinner they hear music which the Maharaja believes is a warning that he will be driven mad like his relatives due to their opposition to the drug cartel and its oppression of the local farmers.\n\nTintin arranges for a dummy to be put in the Maharaja\\\\\\&amp;#039;s bed. That night the dummy is hit by a dart fired by the fakir.\n\nTintin follows the fakir to the cartel\\\\\\&amp;#039;s hideout. The members within dress up in outfits that bear the symbol of Kih-Oskh and make them look rather like the Ku Klux Klan (as Tintin comments in the English edition). He manages to capture the gang which includes the Fakir, the Arab colonel and several others he met in the course of the adventure. He is later joined by the Maharaja, Snowy and Thomson &amp; Thompson. The tomb of Kih-Oskh was found by the Egyptian police. It contained evidence of Tintin\\\\\\&amp;#039;s innocence and a map showing them to the hideout.\n\nThe Fakir manages to escape, however, and later he and the cartel\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Grand Master kidnap the Maharaja\\\\\\&amp;#039;s young son. Tintin chases after them, recovers the boy and captures the Fakir. But the chief falls off a cliff and (presumably) dies. One of the arrested members of the cartel was a servant of the Maharaja. Some cigars found in his room turn out to contain drugs: that is how the smugglers got their product around the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5036d5f73d1f65df03057e86878fcd907deb2283","amp;dn":"Tintin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5036d5f73d1f65df03057e86878fcd907deb2283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,54,213,247,61,31,101,223,3,5,126,134,135,143,205,144,125,235,34,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
