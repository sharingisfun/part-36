After a nostalgic introduction recounting his initial forays into criticism, he presents reviews of the best films of each of the past 38 years, from Bonnie and Clyde to Crash, and a selection of foreign films, documentaries, and &quot;overlooked and underrated&quot; works. More compelling are longer &quot;think pieces&quot; on such topics as colorization, the movie-ratings system, digital projection, and Star Wars' deleterious effect on Hollywood. Those, and a selection of star profiles and interviews, allow him to share his expertise and voice his passion in a fashion that daily reviewing seldom permits. The volume's final selection, a 2004 piece about the healing effect of viewing movies--and of writing about them--during his convalescence from cancer treatment, may well serve as his valedictory. As film criticism becomes more marginalized, Ebert may come to be seen as the last of a kind--the critic who actually has the power to influence a national audience.\n\n- Gordon Flagg, Booklist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a37571270fe471372e90700aa42009bfd7ec1ca","amp;dn":"Awake+in+the+Dark%3A+The+Best+of+Roger+Ebert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a37571270fe471372e90700aa42009bfd7ec1ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,55,87,18,112,254,71,19,114,233,7,0,170,66,0,155,253,126,193,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
