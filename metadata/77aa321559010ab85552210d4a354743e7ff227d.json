I'm a 36 year old guy who like many other blokes groaned about Take That back in the day. Age has obviously matured them but musically is where the real growth has taken place. Long gone is the insipid nonsense of Babe - replaced by proper ballads like What Is Love. Highlights for me are How Did It Come To This and Mark Owen's anthemic Hold Up A Light which come tour time I'm pretty confident will be in huge demand to be played. I liked parts of their last album but the diversity and range of this one makes it a far better record. Long time fans may balk at the dark themes and alternative sounds but for a listener like me not greatly keen on their 90's sound this comes as a welcome change. Well done lads.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77aa321559010ab85552210d4a354743e7ff227d","amp;dn":"Take+that-The+Circus+-+2008+-+P0w3rp0t1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77aa321559010ab85552210d4a354743e7ff227d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,170,50,21,89,1,10,184,85,82,33,13,74,53,71,67,231,255,34,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
