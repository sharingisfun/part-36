The paths of the gods and goddesses cross at a rural funeral and both groups encounter the current incarnation of Thor. But will Axl mate with Derek Thor's daughter, Delphine? Meanwhile, Olaf and Ingrid bond, and Anders and Michele spar with one another.\n\nWith: Ben Barrington as Olaf\n\nGuest Cast: Fern Sutherland as Dawn, Alison Bruce as Agnetha, Rachel Nash as Ingrid, Michelle Langston as Michele, Eve Gordon as Stacey, Geoff Dolan as Derrick, Olivia Tennet as Delphine, Peter Webster as Vicar ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241d439bcf2bb68eb813dd0bf362d7fe38c3145b","amp;dn":"The+Almighty+Johnsons+Season+1+episode+6+-+Goddesses+Axl+Come+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241d439bcf2bb68eb813dd0bf362d7fe38c3145b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,29,67,155,207,43,182,142,184,19,221,11,243,98,215,254,56,195,20,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
