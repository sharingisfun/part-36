The album was released in January 2011 in the UK and Ireland as a repackage of her previous album Greatest Hits. In the US, it was released on May 8, 2012 as an entirely new greatest hits album as part of Sony's The Essential series, and contains songs released during Mariah's time at Columbia Records. It replaces some songs (featured on the original 2001 Greatest Hits release) with their extended club mixes, and others being completely removed in favor of tracks that had not been released as singles. Much of the artwork inside the album booklet is very similar to that of the Greatest Hits release..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Vision Of Love\n[02] Love Takes Time\n[03] Someday\n[04] I Don't Wanna Cry\n[05] Emotions\n[06] Can't Let Go\n[07] Make It Happen\n[08] I'll Be There\n[09] Dreamlover\n[10] Hero\n[11] Without You\n[12] Anytime You Need A Friend\n[13] Endless Love - Luther Vandross Duet With Mariah Carey\n[14] Fantasy\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:59m:13s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] One Sweet Day - Mariah Carey Featuring Boyz II Men\n[02] Always Be My Baby\n[03] Forever\n[04] Underneath The Stars\n[05] Honey\n[06] Butterfly\n[07] My All\n[08] Sweetheart\n[09] When You Believe (From The Prince Of Egypt OST) - Mariah Carey Duet With Whitney Houston\n[10] I Still Believe\n[11] Heartbreaker- Mariah Carey Featuring Jay-Z\n[12] Thank God I Found You - Mariah Carey Featuring Joe &amp; 98 Degrees\n[13] Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\n[14] Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now) - Mariah Carey Featuring Westlife\n[15] All I Want For Christmas Is You (So So Def Remix) - Mariah Carey Featuring Jermaine Dupri &amp; Lil Bow Wow\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:03m:48s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:03m:05s\nTotal File Size....................... 291mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
