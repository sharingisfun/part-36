Jansen posted on her website that while the band was put on hold, she was going to use the opportunity to start writing music with JÃƒÂ¸rn Viggo Lofstad for a new musical project. On February 2009, After Forever ultimately decided to call it quits, and on June 16, 2009, Floor announced through her MySpace site that she had started a new metal band, which put her musical project with JÃƒÂ¸rn Viggo on hold. On October 17, of 2009, Jansen announced that the name of the band was going to be ReVamp.\n\nReVamp entered the studio in the beginning of the year. The album was announced to be scheduled for release in August 2013 through Nuclear Blast again. Jaap Melman decided to quit the band and the decision had a mutual understanding for both parties involved.Since Melman left before any recordings were done for their next album, Stream of Passion bassist Johan van Stratum filled in on short notice. Soon after, Henk Vonk was announced as ReVamp's newest bassist. On June 7, the band announced via Facebook that their new album is going to be called Wild Card. The album will feature several of guest musicians. This includes Johan van Stratum, Mark Jansen of Epica, Marcela Bovio of Stream of Passion, DaniÃƒÂ«l de Jongh of Textures, and finally Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Project.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
