The DVD contains a 2002 documentary outlining the career of BjÃƒÂ¶rk, from her early work in Icelandic bands, to joining The Sugarcubes to her solo work up to 2002. The documentary gives viewers a personal view into her private thoughts, views and motivations. Inside BjÃƒÂ¶rk also features interviews with Sean Penn, Lars von Trier, Thom Yorke, Beck, RZA, Elton John, Missy Elliott, the late Alexander McQueen and more on their thoughts of BjÃƒÂ¶rk and her impact on music and culture. The documentary coincided with the release of the Greatest Hits album, and had previously been seen on some television networks at the end of 2002. It was commissioned by One Little Indian to make up for the fact that BjÃƒÂ¶rk was beginning to do fewer interviews than had been previous.[1] Two small new live performances are included in the documentary, &quot;Generous Palmstroke&quot; performed with Zeena Parkins and an organ version of &quot;The Anchor Song&quot; played in an Icelandic church.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 704x384 - 25fps - 50mn 32s 600ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53f0064ca46de8c47fcc82129af08e160b21c7c6","amp;dn":"Bjork+-+Inside+Bjork+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53f0064ca46de8c47fcc82129af08e160b21c7c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,240,6,76,164,109,232,196,127,204,130,18,154,240,142,22,11,33,199,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
