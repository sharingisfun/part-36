Brand choice decisions ultimately take place inside the consumer's head. Neuroscience, then, holds lessons for how consumers respond to brands and make purchasing decisions. Marketers and brand managers should take note. \n\nErik du Plessis does just that. In this, his second book, du Plessis explores what scientists have uncovered about the structure of the brain and how different parts of the brain interact. He investigates developments in neuroscience and neuromarketing and what lessons this holds for brand managers. What bearing do these developments have on current theories of consumer behavior? How can neuroscience contribute to marketing and brand-building strategies? \n\nIncluding research by Millward Brown, The Branded Mind touches on key topics such as the nature of feelings, moods, personality, measuring the brain, consumer behavior, decision making, and market segmentation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deaa76501c81237176e4b5f401625e7290315f92","amp;dn":"%5B2011%5D+The+Branded+Mind+-+What+Neuroscience+Really+Tells+Us+Abou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deaa76501c81237176e4b5f401625e7290315f92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,170,118,80,28,129,35,113,118,228,181,244,1,98,94,114,144,49,95,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
