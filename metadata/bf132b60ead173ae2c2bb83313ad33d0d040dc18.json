He hopes to bury his past and homestead in Texas, but his plans change when his newspaper-reporter brother (John Champion) is killed. Reluctantly, Cameron buckles on his gun belt and heads out for retribution against crooked gambler Reed Hadley. Making his screenwriting debut, Blake Edwards (who also coproduced the film and played a small supporting role) does his best to steer free of cliches, structuring his script in the manner of the detective stories Edwards had been churning out for radio. No mere B picture, Panhandle was permitted to unspool at an &quot;A&quot; length of 84 minutes. To further assure audience approval, Blake Edwards rewrote the ending, in which hero Rod Cameron had originally been killed off.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033996/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033996/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\n\nMEDIUM AUDIO-VIDEO\n\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:23:56\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 480x352  1.36:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1373 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,28 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf132b60ead173ae2c2bb83313ad33d0d040dc18","amp;dn":"Panhandle+%281948%29+Rod+Cameron+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf132b60ead173ae2c2bb83313ad33d0d040dc18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,19,43,96,234,209,115,174,44,43,184,51,19,173,51,208,208,64,220,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
