What are timbales and sautÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and ingredients, and how do you mix 'em and how long do you bake 'em? Won't somebody please tell me all about it?''\n\nAnd her Pretty Aunt said, ``See the flour all over that new frock!'' and her mother said, ``Dear child, you are not old enough to cooks yet;'' and her grandmother said, ``Just wait a year or two, and I'll teach you myself;''\nand the Other Aunt said, ``Some day you shall go to cookingÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢school and learn everything; you know little girls can't cook.''\n\nBut Margaret said, ``I don't want to wait till I'm big; I want to cook now; and I don't want to do cookingÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢school cooking, but little girl cooking, all by myself.''\nSo she kept on trying to learn, but she burned her fingers and spoiled her dresses worse than ever, and her messes were so bad they had to be thrown out, every one of them; and she cried and cried. And then one day her grandmother said, ``It's a shame that child should not learn to cook if she really wants to so much;'' and\nher mother said ``Yes, it is a shame, and she shall learn! Let's get her a small table and some tins and aprons, and make a little cookÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢book all her own out of the old ones we wrote for ourselves long ago,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢just the plain, easy things anybody can make.'' And both her aunts said, ``Do! We will help, and perhaps we might put in just a few cookingÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢school things beside.''","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f064193a6a47842a33791751bd20a2bb02834962","amp;dn":"A+Little+Cook+Book+for+a+Little+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f064193a6a47842a33791751bd20a2bb02834962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,100,25,58,106,71,132,42,51,121,23,81,189,32,162,187,2,131,73,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
