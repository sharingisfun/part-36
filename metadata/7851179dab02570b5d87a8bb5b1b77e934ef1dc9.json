Ram and Rahim were two different characters \nplaying role of secret agents.\nIn most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist\nor an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring \nback a stolen secret file from the villain's den, before it reaches the enemy nation.\nThe choice of character's name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious\nharmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is \nthe son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by \nfanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. \nRam is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.\nRam is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship \nand both will work together to save the world.\nThey have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.\nIn later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm \nthat has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.\nChildren used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special \neditions of Ram-Rahim's and Crookbond's comics during summer holidays.\n\nCOMICS LIST:\n\n032 Halli Ki Yatra.cbr\t14.24 MB\n033 Space King ka Ant.cbr\t11.28 MB\n059 Khooni Bhediya.cbr\t8.45 MB\n060 Aag Laga Desh.pdf\t12.73 MB\n061 Bijli Ke Bete.pdf\t5.83 MB\n062 Registan Ki Aag.pdf\t16.08 MB\n063 Wahshi Katil.pdf\t8.92 MB\n064 Ichadhari Naagin.pdf\t12.82 MB\n065 Ichadhari Naagin Aur Shaitan Nevlaa.pdf\t17.09 MB\n066 Watan Ke Dushman.pdf\t9.19 MB\n067 Tabahi Ka Suraj.pdf\t13.52 MB\n068 Jal Utha Akash.pdf\t5.76 MB\n069 Ek Raat Ka Samrat.pdf\t5.36 MB\n072 Dracula Ki Waapsi.pdf\t10.63 MB\n073 Dracula Delhi Mein.pdf\t3.21 MB\n074 Tantrik Jangula.pdf\t11.31 MB\n075 Khopdi Ka Hungama.pdf\t16.55 MB\n076 Maut Ka Aspatal.pdf\t6.00 MB\n077 Sone Ki Kabar.pdf\t12.61 MB\n078 Sarp Mandir Aur Takla Shaitan.pdf\t12.23 MB\n079 Khooni Jawalamukhi aur Narpishach.cbr\t11.31 MB\n080 Kaalnaag.pdf\t20.72 MB\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADERS.\nCOMMENT IF YOU LIKE THEM.\nAND REMEMBER TO SEED.\nTHANKS\n-SANJEET","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7851179dab02570b5d87a8bb5b1b77e934ef1dc9","amp;dn":"MANOJ+COMICS+%28HINDI%29+RAM-RAHIM+SET-04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7851179dab02570b5d87a8bb5b1b77e934ef1dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,81,23,157,171,2,87,11,93,135,168,187,91,27,119,233,52,239,29,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
