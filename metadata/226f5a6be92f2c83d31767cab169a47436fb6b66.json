And yet it took the combined armies of the Inner Sphere more than twenty years to subjugate them during the forming of the first Star League half millennia ago.\n\nMagistracy of Canopus, Taurian Concordat, Marian Hegemony, Outworlds Alliance and Circinus Federation. Each is a unique star-spanning empire whose hardy-people have carved out their freedom with bare hands: an identity they will not give up without a fight. Even the Great Houses have begun to learn that underestimating these Periphery States is dangerous indeed.\n\nHandbook: Major Periphery States collates the essential history, politics and culture of the Major Periphery States into a single volume. More than a mere sourcebook, Handbook: Major Periphery States provides rules for both BattleTech and A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG game play, including new support vehicles, creatures and more!\n\n\nThank you to the guys and gals who share and make these Classic BattleTech book collection possible.
