The whole show was recorded \r\nprofessionally and initially was thought as a part of How The West \r\nWas Won album but abandoned later in procees of mixing, mainly \r\nbecause of fact the overall level of performance wasn't enough \r\nsatisfying.\r\n\r\nSource: \r\nIncomplete superb soundboard recording. 152 minutes.\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nThe recording is a fully professional mixdown of multitrack\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1. Rock and Roll\r\n2. Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n3. Black Dog\r\n4. Misty Mountain Hop\r\n5. Since I've Been Loving You\r\n6. Dancing Days\r\n7. The Song Remains The Same\r\n8. The Rain Song\r\n9. Dazed and Confused\r\n10. Stairway to Heaven\r\n11. Whole Lotta Love\r\n12. Heartbreaker\r\n13. Thank You\r\n14. How Many More Times\r\n15. Communication Breakdown\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThe show finds the Zeppelin in a smaller venue on a small, carpeted stage. \r\nThis seems to lend itself to the type of performance given that night - very \r\nrelaxed, very loose, very cool. Sloppiness abounds, even on well-rehearsed \r\nlong-time standards, and occasionally yields interesting differences. \r\nBron-Yr-Aur Stomp was dropped out from the set for the second time during \r\nthis tour. Of particular and special note is an off-hand performance of How \r\nMany More Times, which had been retired just over two years prior. You can \r\nhear the band play off of each other as they all take turns guiding the music's \r\ndirection. Plant's voice is shot for most of the performance, typical for the \r\ntime period. Page experiences sloppiness syndrome on occasion and keeps most \r\nof his solos a bit subdued. Bonham also seems to withhold some of the flair - \r\nextra fills and subtle nuances - for most of the show. Jones, however, other \r\nthan a meandering introduction to Thank You, lays down his bass lines as \r\nexcellently as ever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04bce2620e0fbd886bd0b46016e3d8a0add7369c","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.01.22+Southampton%2C+England+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04bce2620e0fbd886bd0b46016e3d8a0add7369c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,188,226,98,14,15,189,136,107,208,180,96,22,227,216,160,173,215,54,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
