But none is more amazing than the brain, that bundle of nerve cells that allows us to sense our surroundings, sort out information, and make decisions. Indeed, the great importance of BRAIN POWER to evolution is the subject of this weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s installment of NATUREÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s TRIUMPH OF LIFE series.\n\nBrains are not essential to life. Many organisms, from algae to jellyfish, get along just fine without a central information-processing center. But there is no question that a brain gives many animals an edge. For in the struggle for survival, brawn often gives way to a brain that can outthink a competitor.\n\nNot all brains are equal, however. Some brains consist of just a few hundred or few thousand cells, just enough to sense changes in light or temperature, or to sniff out important smells. Others, like ours, contain billions of cells, enabling everything from language to tool-making.\n\nBut simple is often more than enough to assure an animalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s survival. A flatwormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basic brain, for instance, helps it sniff out earthworms, making the worm a lethal hunter. And while a honeybeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brain is bigger than a flatwormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, it is still not all that complex. Nonetheless, the bee is capable of amazing feats of memory, as BRAIN POWER shows.\n\nIn their short two-month lives, worker bees must learn to remember where nectar-producing flowers are located in relation to the hive, and exactly what time of day they produce the sweet liquid. The life-or-death memorization is aided by an amazing change in the beeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brain: as it needs to retain more information, the brain grows, adding tens of thousands of cells on an as-needed basis! Once, scientists believed that such brain-changing abilities were limited to just a few animals. In recent years, however, evidence has shown that many animalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ brains are more flexible than once thought possible. Some birds, for instance, grow new brain tissue during the breeding season ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perhaps to sing more complex songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then lose the cells once mating is over. Other bird brains grow or shrink for migration.\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: David Heeley &amp; Suzanne Weinert\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Triumph Of Life-Brain Power\nYear:  2001\nFile Size: 742 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:51\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1918 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (External English)\n \n\n  \n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:048eb770d2a885590f14cf5d9844e2f48f98709b","amp;dn":"Triumph+Of+Life-Brain+Power-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"048eb770d2a885590f14cf5d9844e2f48f98709b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,142,183,112,210,168,133,89,15,20,207,93,152,68,226,244,143,152,112,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
