With a funny and compassionate, yet tell-it-like-it-is style, she looks at the relationship between feeling powerful in life and accessing life's pleasures, and their combined effect on sexual desire. Resh introduces six essential qualities that women must have to live healthfully, stating that when these are out of balance women seem to exist in lives devoid of pleasure, self-empowerment, and sex. These markers of emotional well-being are:\n\n- Self-confidence and self-esteem\n- Healthy Habits\n- Spiritual Satisfaction\n- Creativity\n- Self-assurance/re-assurance\n- Compassion and Empathy\n\nOnce the six traits are laid out, Resh devotes the rest of the book to exploring how, when one or more of a woman's markers of emotional well-being are off kilter, their reasons for avoiding sex mount exponentially. She looks at some of the most common excuses she's heard over her many years as a sexuality counselor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I Feel Nothing, It's All He Thinks About, I'm Too Busy!, \n\nI'm Too Fat to Have Sex Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and outlines the specific imbalances that create this void of sexual desire and activity. With practical guidance, self-assessment questions, and stories from her practice and personal life, Resh explains to modern women how to regain their emotional wellness and live a powerful life that includes a steady relationship with pleasure and sexual satisfaction.\n\nThis book is a must read for all women. From housewives to sophisticated urban corporate types, from new moms to post-menopausal women Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this book will help any woman who feels estranged from her sexual energy and a sense of empowerment, and deprived of pleasure, or who views sex as just another thing to tick off her overwhelming to-do list.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Psychology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978e1bf3442361a06baa29544d4831aa2dde8bc4","amp;dn":"Women%2C+Sex%2C+Power%2C+and+Pleasure+by+Evelyn+Resh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978e1bf3442361a06baa29544d4831aa2dde8bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,142,27,243,68,35,97,160,107,170,41,84,77,72,49,170,45,222,139,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
