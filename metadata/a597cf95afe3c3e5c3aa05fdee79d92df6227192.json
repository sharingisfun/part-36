Bierbrier\nPublisher: The Scarecrow Press, Inc. | ISBN: 0810857944 | edition 2008 | PDF | 488 pages\n\nThe &quot;Historical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot; is a quick and accurate ready reference for both the Egyptologist and the non-specialist. It presents the important people and places in ancient Egyptian history as well as those in the history of Egyptology. Coverage is given to ancient Egyptian rulers, bureaucrats, and commoners whose records have survived, to ancient society, religion, and gods, and to the people and places significant to modern archaeological discoveries and scholarship. An important part of this work, not featured in other dictionaries, is a detailed bibliography of the historic periods, archaeological sites, and other important aspects of ancient Egyptian studies. The bibliography presents the most up-to-date monographs on these themes, many of which have appeared only in recent years and may not be known to the public at large.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a597cf95afe3c3e5c3aa05fdee79d92df6227192","amp;dn":"Historical+Dictionary+of+Ancient+Egypt%2C+2nd+Edition+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a597cf95afe3c3e5c3aa05fdee79d92df6227192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,151,207,149,175,227,195,229,195,170,5,253,238,121,217,45,246,34,113,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
