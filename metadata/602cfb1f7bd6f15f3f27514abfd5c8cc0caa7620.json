The humor in this movie is\nconveyed elegantly. For example the director of &quot;Kiru,&quot; Okamoto, who also\ndirected Sword of Doom, included a stone Buddha atop of the hill overlooking\nthe desolate town setting of the movie in reference to &quot;Daibosatsu Toge&quot; which\nmeans &quot;Great Buddha Pass&quot; (the Japanese title for Sword of Doom). Okay that\nwasn&amp;#039;t the best example, but can you imagine henchmen screaming EXTRA loud\nwhen they are butchered? Or how about a grimy farmer turning away a cute girl\nhe calls a &quot;powdered monster!&quot; Amidst the exaggerated dust storms, references\nto the value of rice, mountain treks and the trouble 7 &quot;children&quot; or samurai\ncause when planning a conspiracy is a trio of heroes: a farmer who yearns to be\na samurai, the last henchmen of an annihilated gang, and a vagabond (rather than\na dashing ronin) played by Tatsuya Nakadai. Yes, there are staring duels, flying\ndaggers, great fight scenes with wooden swords, but lastly a showdown that is\nNOT in the middle of a ghost town or rolling field -- but in a tiny room.\n\nThis film is for the fans!!!
