Mourn (APB Remix) \n\nProving that unbridled aggression isn&amp;#039;t always needed to effectively get one&amp;#039;s point across in industrial dance music, Norway&amp;#039;s Apoptygma Berzerk take a melodic, almost synth-pop-like approach on their second full-length, 7. This domestic issue of an album originally released in Europe in 1996 proves a great introduction to the thoughtful music of Stephan Groth (a.k.a. Grothesk). &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; establishes the gothic tone of the disc, starting things off with grand-guignol organ music that gives way to driving synths and beats, followed by Grothesk&amp;#039;s unprocessed vocals and a few sampled refrains from Carmina Burana. &quot;Mourn,&quot; a delicate, stripped-down electro track dedicated to Kurt Cobain, shows off Groth&amp;#039;s talent for melodic songwriting, a rarity in a genre often criticized for its lack of subtlety. Other highlights include the energetic Front 242-isms of &quot;Non-Stop Violence&quot; and the sharp techno inflections of &quot;Deep Red&quot; (complete with Laibach sample!).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04b3c6be7e4200a81e4cba58fd156d53d5d7b5da","amp;dn":"Apoptygma+Berzerk+-+7%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04b3c6be7e4200a81e4cba58fd156d53d5d7b5da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,179,198,190,126,66,0,168,30,76,186,88,253,21,109,83,213,215,181,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
