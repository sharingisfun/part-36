But has industry been honest? Cold, Hungry and in the Dark argues that declining productivity combined with increasing demand will trigger a crisis that will cause prices to skyrocket, damage the economy, and have a profound impact on the lives of nearly every North American.\n\nRelying on faulty science, bought-and-paid-for-white papers masquerading as independent research and &quot;industry consultants,&quot; the &quot;shale promoters&quot; have vastly overstated the viable supply of shale gas resources for their own financial gain. This startling exposÃƒÂ©, written by an industry insider, suggests that the stakes involved in the Enron scandal might seem like lunch money in comparison to the bursting of the natural gas bubble. Exhaustively researched and rigorously documented, Cold, Hungry and in the Dark:\n\n    *Puts supply-and-demand trends under a microscope\n    *Provides overwhelming evidence of the absurdity of the one hundred-year supply myth\n    *Suggests numerous ways to mitigate the upcoming natural gas price spike\n\nThe mainstream media has told us that natural gas will be cheap and plentiful for decades, when nothing could be further from the truth. Forewarned is forearmed. Cold, Hungry and in the Dark is vital reading for anyone concerned about the inevitable economic impact of our uncertain energy future.\n\n336 pages\nPublisher: New Society Publishers (July 2, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0865717435\nISBN-13: 978-0865717435","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b03a7ba1c05b44b570af5b29d3b51f5525756e0","amp;dn":"Exploding+the+Natural+Gas+Suppth+%282013%29+by+Bill+Powers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b03a7ba1c05b44b570af5b29d3b51f5525756e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,3,167,186,28,5,180,75,87,10,245,178,157,59,81,245,82,87,86,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
