Aimed at producing a &amp;#039;live feel&amp;#039; to psychedelic dub, to mash it up with heavy bassline while tripping away to hi-fidelity sound.......upbeat yet ambient, fluffy yet grunty. After some crazy, if somewhat sparodic festival gigs in 2007 ( including Skanival and Eastern Haze ), the honkies were joined by Ali W, an old friend and accomplished musician.With the traditional Indian sound of the Sarangi, Ali has added another dimension to this digi-dub project.\n\nEnjoy people !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab8a326671df0974fd59bb072116ea0ec6a0d48","amp;dn":"Honky+Dub+Inc+-+Lovely+Dubbly+.2008.mp3.192.kbps%5BPSYDUB.release%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab8a326671df0974fd59bb072116ea0ec6a0d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,184,163,38,103,29,240,151,79,213,155,176,114,17,110,160,236,106,13,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
