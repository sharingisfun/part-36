The main idea of the game is you must climb a gigantic Tower as fast as possible while avoiding to be kicked down by its security system (robots, turrets...): on your way to the top, you will eventually figure out the truth behind this strange universe.\n\nThe Alpha version is 3 of the intended 5 main levels + 6/10 Sparks (maps dedicated to Speedrun), the demo has one small level.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, but so far I haven't had any glitches at all.\n\nI haven't tested this on windows 8.1 yet, so if you DL this, then please give feedback on how it went.\n\nThe devs could use some support on this, it's a small indie group called 5-Bits Games, so if you can afford it, when the full game is released, buy it to help them bring us more of these types of games.\n\nMinimum requirements:\n- Intel Core-2-Duo 2 GHz or similar\n- 1 Gig of Ram\n- DX9 3D video card such as Nvidia 8600 GT or ATI Radeon X1950 pro\n\nRecommended:\n- Intel Core-2-Quad 2.4GHz or similar\n- 2 Gig of Ram\n- DX9 3D video card such as Nvidia GTX280 or Radeon HD5850 or newer.\n  \n\nTested on Windows 7 32bit - Unsure about Windows 8.1, or 64bit.\n\n\nPics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAOMnaafH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAOMnaafH&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e0abdf93116de35881668224e9aa032f39c7b42","amp;dn":"DeadCore+%28Alpha%29+%2B+Xpadder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e0abdf93116de35881668224e9aa032f39c7b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,10,189,249,49,22,222,53,136,22,104,34,78,154,160,50,243,156,123,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
