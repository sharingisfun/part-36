It describes how the deep strategic differences that emerged at the end of the Cold War and the disputes over the Balkans and the Middle East during the Clinton years already had some analysts questioning whether the Alliance could survive. It shows how the Bush administrationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unilateral diplomacy and world-view helped bring already simmering tensions to a boil, and describes in depth the events leading up to the Iraq crisis of 2003.\n\nGordon and Shapiro explain how powerful forces such rising American power and the September 11 terrorist attacks have made relations between America and Europe increasingly difficult. But the authors argue that the split over Iraq was not inevitable: it was the result of misguided decisions and unnecessary provocations on both sides. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that claims that the Iraq war signaled the effective end of the Atlantic Alliance, the authors warn that assuming the end of the Alliance could quickly become a self-fulfilling prophesy: leaving the United States isolated, resented, and responsible for bearing the burdens of maintaining international security largely alone.\n\nIn response to those who argue that the Atlantic Alliance is no longer viable or necessary, ALLIES AT WAR demonstrates that even after Iraq, the United States and Europe can work together, and indeed must if they wish to effectively address the most pressing problems of our age. The book makes concrete proposals for restoring transatlantic relations and updating the alliance to meet new challenges like global terrorism and the transformation of an unstable Middle East.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 268 pages\n# Publisher: McGraw-Hill; 1 edition (April 1, 2004)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0071441204\n# ISBN-13: 978-0071441209","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8ac826710a80ceecf4e3ded1be3a6b8ad28db9","amp;dn":"Allies+At+War%3A+America%2C+Europe+and+the+Crisis+Over+Iraq+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8ac826710a80ceecf4e3ded1be3a6b8ad28db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,138,200,38,113,10,128,206,236,244,227,222,209,190,58,107,138,210,141,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
