Even though Ã¢â‚¬Å“MindlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, they have existed for over a decade. All this time they have released several demos but it was in  2012 when they started working on their first full-length release. Coma, as I said earlier, are honoring the 80s-90s heavy-thrash roots. References from Metallica, Megadeth, Testament, Anthrax, Slayer &amp; Overkill among others, are embellishing the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound in general. Most of the times they are more into the old-school thrash, but then again some heavy-thrash &amp; melodic features are being thrown in. The instruments were recorded in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own home studio and the vocals at the V-studio. The album was mixed by Riccardo Atzeni (ex-Solid Vision and Dominici) and mastered by Ettore Rigotti. The sound is quite heavy and powerful. Overall it is very good, even if it misses that punchier &amp; tighter element the big heavy-thrash bands have. But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something that can easily be fixed in the future. There are also two guest appearances on the album by Craig Locicero (Forbidden) &amp; eRik Atzeni (ex-Solid Vision, ex-Dominici). Coma are showing very good signs. They have Ã¢â‚¬Å“studiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ their lessons well and they have the desire to go on. I would prefer them to take care of their melodies a bit more than the aggressive-fast pace elements at some point. The heavy-thrash clichÃƒÂ©s of the genre are present all over the album but when they go a tad more melodic &amp; heavier I favor them utmost. Anyhow, this is just my point of view. I think that this is a solid debut album and Coma can be way improved in the years to comeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c0f2fea10d8de3fb30179599903467ecfd7196","amp;dn":"Coma+-+Mindless+%28320+CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c0f2fea10d8de3fb30179599903467ecfd7196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,192,242,254,161,13,141,227,251,48,23,149,153,144,52,103,236,253,113,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
