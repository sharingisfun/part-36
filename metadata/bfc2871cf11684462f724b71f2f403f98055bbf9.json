Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect. Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder. Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures. \n\n\n\nVertaling: Jesse, Quetsbeek en DÃƒÂ©sirÃƒÂ©e\n\n\n\nSeizoen 1 Aflevering 13: The Boy with the Bucket\n\nWhen Langston, Walter's older brother comes to town, he asks Walter to go see their dying father whose last wish is for Walter to find his first love...
