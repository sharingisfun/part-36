Tyler Doherty is an extraordinary eight-year-old boy. Surrounded by a loving family and community, and armed with the courage of his faith, he faces his daily battle against cancer with bravery and grace. To Tyler, God is a friend, a teacher and the ultimate pen pal-Tyler's prayers take the form of letters, which he composes and mails on a daily basis. The letters find their way into the hands of Brady McDaniels, a beleaguered postman standing at a crossroads in his life. At first, he is confused and conflicted over what to do with the letters. But the decision he ultimately makes becomes a testament to the quiet power of one boy's shining spirit and unshakable faith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86233e6bc85a8f30c07cc2ac45e8bdf24f57a17b","amp;dn":"Letters+To+God%5B2010%5DDvDrip-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86233e6bc85a8f30c07cc2ac45e8bdf24f57a17b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,35,62,107,200,90,143,48,192,124,194,172,69,232,189,242,79,87,161,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
