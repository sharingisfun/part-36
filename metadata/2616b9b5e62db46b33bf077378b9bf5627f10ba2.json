But in this case I make an exception because obviously Director James Whale was having a little fun with the audience by now used to Universal Studios horror film products. Whale creates a film of dark moods and light banter among the guests who can't quite figure out what's with this family of weirdos.\n\nThe Old Dark House marked the American film debut of Charles Laughton and Laughton overacts outrageously as does the whole cast in the role a bluff, overbearing, but essentially good hearted Manchester businessman who's got himself a Sir before his name and is right proud of it. This was also early work for Melvyn Douglas and Raymond Massey as another two of the guests.\n\nBoris Karloff plays the sinister and mute servant Morgan. Karloff had one of the great speaking voices ever in films and interesting that this and his break through role as the Frankenstein monster required no dialog.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2616b9b5e62db46b33bf077378b9bf5627f10ba2","amp;dn":"Old+Dark+House+The+%28Boris+Karloff%29+%5B1932%5D+%40%21.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2616b9b5e62db46b33bf077378b9bf5627f10ba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,22,185,181,230,45,180,107,51,191,7,115,120,185,191,86,39,241,11,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
