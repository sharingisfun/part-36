Here's the classic haunting Stanley sound, and here are the original versions of songs that went on to become bluegrass classics, like The Fields Have Turned Brown, The White Dove, I Love No One But You, The Drunkard's Hell, Hey! Hey! Hey!, A Life Of Sorrow and The Lonesome River. Not only has the sound been lovingly restored, but there are two alternate takes never heard before. Classic! Essential! CD comes with 20-page booklet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc46545e850c2b6884bd270847fe20beff474106","amp;dn":"The+Stanley+Brothers+%26amp%3B+The+Clinch+Mountain+Boys+1949-52+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc46545e850c2b6884bd270847fe20beff474106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,70,84,94,133,12,43,104,132,189,39,8,71,254,32,190,255,71,65,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
