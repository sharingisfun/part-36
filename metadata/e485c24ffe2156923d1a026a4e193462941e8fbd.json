They became known as the YBAs and changed the face of art. Among them, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, the Chapman Brothers, Sam Taylor Wood and Gavin Turk. Love them or loath them, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re impossible to ignore. &quot;\nSpandau Ballet's Gary Kemp investigates the modern art world, 25 years since it was rocked on its heels by the arrival of Hirst, Emin and the other Young British Artists.\n\nWhile better known as a musician and actor, Gary is also an art enthusiast, building up his own significant collection of British art, as well as furniture. He argues that it was the rock and roll style of the YBAs which made contemporary art relevant and altered the cultural life of Britain.\n \nKemp considers the extent to which the YBAs,  with their love of glitz and glamour and outrageous posturing,  act more like rock stars from his own world, in a film which includes interviews with several YBAs, including Sam Taylor-Wood, Gavin Turk and Jake Chapman. \n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5419353d3a1418677a64&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo: Bitrate: 1928 Kbps\nVideo: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo: Resolution: 832 x 468\nAudio: Codec: AAC LC \nAudio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio: Channels: stereo (2/0) \nAudio: English \nRun-Time: 49mins\nFramerate: 29fps\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 665 MB\nContainer: Mp4\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.itv.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e485c24ffe2156923d1a026a4e193462941e8fbd","amp;dn":"ITV.Perspectives.2014.Kick.Out.The.Jams.PDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e485c24ffe2156923d1a026a4e193462941e8fbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,133,194,79,254,33,86,146,61,26,2,106,78,25,52,98,148,30,143,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
