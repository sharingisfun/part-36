Best of all, once itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s established, an ecological garden will reduce or eliminate most of the backbreaking work thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needed to maintain the typical lawn and garden.&quot;\n\nThe first edition of Gaia's Garden, sparked the imagination of America's home gardeners, introducing permaculture's central message: Working with Nature, not against her, results in more beautiful, abundant, and forgiving gardens. This extensively revised and expanded second edition broadens the reach and depth of the permaculture approach for urban and suburban growers. Many people mistakenly think that ecological gardening which involves growing a wide range of edible and other useful plants can take place only on a large, multiacre scale. As Hemenway demonstrates, it's fun and easy to create a backyard ecosystem by assembling communities of plants that can work cooperatively and perform a variety of functions, including: \n\n  Building and maintaining soil fertility and structure\n  Catching and conserving water in the landscape,\n  Providing habitat for beneficial insects, birds,and animals.\n  Growing an edible forest that yields seasonal fruits, nuts, and other foods. \n\nThis revised and updated edition also features a new chapter on urban permaculture, designed especially for people in cities and suburbs who have very limited growing space. Whatever size yard or garden you have to work with, you can apply basic permaculture principles to make it more diverse, more natural, more productive, and more beautiful. Best of all, once it's established, an ecological garden will reduce or eliminate most of the backbreaking work that's needed to maintain the typical lawn and garden.\n\nBiography:\n\nToby Hemenway is the author of Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture, which for the past six years has been the world's best-selling book on permaculture, a design approach based on ecology for creating sustainable landscapes, homes, communities, and workplaces.
