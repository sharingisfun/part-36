If you're already a fan, you'll like it...if you've never heard it but like the genre (ie: fellow Canadian Michael Buble), you will like Matt Dusk.\n\nI got tired of waiting for someone else to up it so i bought it and am uppin it myself.  I scanned the entire booklet and covers but I'm not terribly pleased with the results...viewable/printable but there was something on the scanner I didn't know about until after i scanned them all...oh well, good enough i suppose.\n\nL8R...enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7018f344f58922024f5302c20c7b0197129b1b2","amp;dn":"Matt+Dusk+-+%282009%29+Good+News","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7018f344f58922024f5302c20c7b0197129b1b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,1,143,52,79,88,146,32,36,245,48,44,32,199,176,25,113,41,177,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
