The author formulates the physical properties of crystals systematically in tensor notation, presenting tensor properties in terms of their common mathematical basis and the thermodynamic relations between them. The mathematical groundwork is laid in a discussion of tensors of the first and second ranks. Tensors of higher ranks and matrix methods are then introduced as natural developments of the theory. A similar pattern is followed in discussing thermodynamic and optical aspects.\n\nPublication Date: July 11, 1985 | ISBN-10: 0198511655 | ISBN-13: 978-0198511656","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bba7a5b34d697743e21199ef01dfdb082e67302","amp;dn":"%5BJohn_F_Nye%5D_Physical_properties_of_crystals.djvu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bba7a5b34d697743e21199ef01dfdb082e67302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,186,122,91,52,214,151,116,62,33,25,158,240,29,253,176,130,230,115,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
