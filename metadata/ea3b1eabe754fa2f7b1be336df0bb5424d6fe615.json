Yes? I am too. Which is why I have decided to create this torrent of the entire Percy Jackson and the Olympians series; with proper formatting, layout, table of contents and metadata (for both iTunes and Calibre). Any missing chapters which may have been previously present have been manually added in by me. These are probably the best copies of the books you'll find on the web.\n\nThis upload does not include Rick Riordan's books from his new series Heroes of Olympus; which is continued off from the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I may upload them in a later torrent.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad. If you wish to read .ePub doucuments on a Mac/PC I would recommend downloading Adobe Digital Editions. (Just google it and follow the instructions on the Adobe website.)\nHere is a screenshot of it in action: i.imgur.com/G3FK0.png\n\n.mobi -\nFor the Amazon kindle. Kindle for PC may also be available depending on your region.\nNote: No .PDF files are provided as it is an inferior format for eBook novels.\n\nBooks included:\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians 1 - The Lightning Thief (2005)\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians 2 - The Sea of Monsters (2006)\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians 3 - The Titan's Curse (2007)\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians 4 - The Battle of the Labyrinth (2008)\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians 4.5 - The Demigod Files (2009)\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians 5 - The Last Olympian (2009)\n\nEnjoy! If you enjoy the books support the author by purchasing them!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3b1eabe754fa2f7b1be336df0bb5424d6fe615","amp;dn":"Percy+Jackson+and+the+Olympians%3A+Complete+Series+%28ePub%2Fmobi%29+-+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3b1eabe754fa2f7b1be336df0bb5424d6fe615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,59,30,171,231,84,250,47,123,27,227,54,223,11,181,66,77,111,230,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
