A fresh psychedelic progressive sound, with reggae/dub and minimal/techno influences, in a range between 121 and 130 bpm, with deep basses and crunchy sinths, addition of arps, sinthetic dub voices and gated melodic arrangements. A must to put in the car and in the new style dj bag.\n\t\nA new journey to the future of psychedelic progressive music. A meltin' pot experience around the globe of sounds. Enjoy the music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be677e9dc14e4d44eb5f2a652ff672ddecb4f926","amp;dn":"Gaiatech+-+Progressive+Re-Birth+-+2012+%5Bprogressive+trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be677e9dc14e4d44eb5f2a652ff672ddecb4f926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,103,126,157,193,78,77,68,235,95,42,101,47,246,114,221,236,180,249,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
