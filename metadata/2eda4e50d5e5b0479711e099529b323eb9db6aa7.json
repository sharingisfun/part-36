Driven by the bittersweet, ironic songwriting of Luke Haines, the band's carefully crafted, three-minute pop songs are in the vein of the Kinks, the Smiths and the Beatles, particularly the songs of George Harrison. Yet the band never sounds like imitators -- they combine their influences into a signature sound, distinguished by Haines' sharp lyrics and sighing melodies.
