Math teacher Anders Henrikson, recently released from a mental institution, decides to exorcise his inner demons in film form. Henrikson persuades film director Hasse Ekman, a former student, to put together a film depicting an Earth in the hands of the Devil. Ekman passes the idea on to writer Birger Malmstein, who coincidentally is currently going through Hell on Earth with his prostitute lover (Doris Svedlund). She, in turn, is being tormented by her former pimp. A black-Sabbath variation on Schnitzler's La Ronde, The Devil's Wanton was produced by Lorens Malmstadt, the man who first saw box-office potential in Bergman, even with bleak, defeatist films of this nature. Originally titled Fangelse, The Devil's Wanton has also been released as Prison.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Devil's Wanton.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 15mn\n      Bit rate : 1296 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.23 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Svenska\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 15mn\n      Bit rate : 1164 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.160\n      StreamSize : 626 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 15mn\n      Bit rate : 127 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 68.4 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nIMDB: tt0041399\n\nSwedish audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a95ab99daec013d9689279dcb339db75f3d9bf","amp;dn":"The+Devil%5C%27s+Wanton+%28Fangelsee%29+-+Bergman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a95ab99daec013d9689279dcb339db75f3d9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,169,90,185,157,174,192,19,217,104,146,121,220,179,57,219,117,243,217,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
