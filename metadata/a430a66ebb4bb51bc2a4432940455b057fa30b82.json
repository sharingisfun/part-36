Born in surroundings consisting of depressing Eastern European blocks of flats, abandoned factories and rusty unused railways, Bodycall started as a hybrid of many dark underground electronic styles. Bodycall&amp;#039;s musicians were, at various stages involved in numerous death metal/grindcore bands, several hardcore techno, trance or, more recently, dark electronic projects.\n\n&quot;Somatic Turn&quot; is hard to classify. There are purely dark electro or ebm songs as well as classic synthpop or darkwave ones. It is likely to attract a wide spectrum of listeners. Nearly every follower of the &quot;Dark Scene&quot; will find something for him/herself. Very good add to your musical library - whether you are a fan of dark electro, synthpop, ebm, darkwawe, even gothic - or you just like a bit of everything of this sort.\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
