Bloomfield worked with a bunch of bands during the decade, and the compilation flits rather hurriedly from his contributions to The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Electric Flag, to his collaborations with Al Kooper, and some of his late-'60s solo tracks (none of his groundbreaking mid-'60s work with Dylan is here). Collectors will be interested in the first five songs, which date from previously unreleased sessions produced by John Hammond in late 1964 and early 1965","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff9b2d6edb2a84c4d3f31d952f70374a7e17353","amp;dn":"Michael+Bloomfield+-+Don%27t+Say+That+I+Ain%27t+Your+Man%21+Essential+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ff9b2d6edb2a84c4d3f31d952f70374a7e17353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,249,178,214,237,178,168,76,77,63,49,217,82,247,3,116,167,225,115,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
