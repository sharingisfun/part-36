Israel has obliterated the deep underground nuclear weapons facility built by Iran. The United States has destroyed the nuclear facility of a defiant North Korea.\n\nAgainst this background, the Russians have upped the stakes in the latest world power-playÃ¢â‚¬â€cyber warfareÃ¢â‚¬â€to reduce the United States to helplessness: a three-strike missile attack on the National Security Agency at Fort Mead, Maryland, while simultaneously jamming the top-secret electronic access key to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nuclear launch systemÃ¢â‚¬â€the nuclear football. If successful, Russia would blow the United States off the nuclear map.\n\nMeanwhile the British Royal Navy, formerly the most powerful in the world, is rapidly crumbling, leaving the United States without its main deep sea ally at a time when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re needed most.\n\nAs this geo-political battle comes to light behind close doors dealings and dark secrets, it is up to Mossad spymaster, codenamed the Ã¢â‚¬ËœGolan,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to avert the Russian scheme, and there is only one man he in turn can trust to get the job done: US Navy Seal Mack Bedford.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
