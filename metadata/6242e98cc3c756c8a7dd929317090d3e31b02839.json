A gorgeous universal app for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, with everything from a multitouch trackpad to full extended keyboard support, and with no-configuration control of dozens of the best Mac applications, it is a must-have for any home media center or presentation! Please read the full description and requirements below :)\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come with a remote control or doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even have an infrared port. The Apple Remote or a 3rd party infrared receiver would cost a significant amount. Add ANOTHER hit to your wallet for a wireless keyboard and mouse!\n\nYou carry your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer? Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote Pro! Rowmote Pro is like your Mac or Apple TVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! Trackpad and keyboard give you complete control over your computer, and you can control, launch, and quit apps, toggle the iTunes Visualizer, and more without ever having to squint at your screen. Rowmote is Mac-like from the ground up.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Control your Mac or Apple TV completely over a wireless network.
