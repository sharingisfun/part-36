He was famously difficult but his stubbornness and horrendous timekeeping did nothing to deter his patrons who included the Hapsburgs, the Pope and his family and Charles V.\n\nDuring his career, which spanned more than seventy years, Titian painted around five or six hundred pictures of which less than half survive. His work has been studied by generations of great artists from Rubens to Manet and he is often seen as having artistically transcended his own time.\n\nSheila Hale not only examines his life, both personal and professional, but how his art affected his contemporaries and how it influences artists today. She also examines Venice in its context of a city at the time of the Renaissance, overshadowed artistically by Rome and Florence and growing into the famous historical city it has become.\n\nFully illustrated with four colour plate sections (including his famous works Ã¢â‚¬ËœReclining VenusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeath of ActaeonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThree Ages of ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), this is an astonishing portrait of one of the most important figures in the history of Western art and a vivid evocation of Venice in its Ã¢â‚¬ËœGolden AgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84e77e05a529b05709281a47aaa968b0edac8c3d","amp;dn":"Titian%3A+His+Life+-+Sheila+Hale+%282012+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84e77e05a529b05709281a47aaa968b0edac8c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,231,126,5,165,41,176,87,9,40,26,71,170,169,104,176,237,172,140,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
