He was created by writers Charles Biro and Dick Wood and artist Al Camy. In 1986, Eclipse Comics published a new Airboy series, updated to the modern era, starring the son of the original character. The 50-issue comic (15 July 1986 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Oct. 1989), which ran as a half-sized (16-page) bi-weekly through issue No. 33 (1 Nov. 1987) and monthly thereafter, reintroduced many of the supporting characters from the old series, such as Valkyrie and a Japanese fighter pilot named Hirota, and guest-starred many of the characters who had appeared as backups in the original comics. Chuck Dixon scripted with the occasional assistance of Tim Truman, with Truman, Ron Randall and Stan Woch the main illustrators.\n\nThe first Airboy was David (&quot;Davy&quot;) Nelson II, the son of an expert pilot and, despite his youth, a crack flyer himself. His friend, inventor and Franciscan monk Brother Francis Martier, had created a highly maneuverable prototype aircraft that flew by flapping its wings, like a bird. Martier, however, was killed while testing it, and Davy inherited both the plane and a uniform, which had apparently been in Martier's family since the French Revolution. Davy soon christened himself &quot;Airboy&quot;, and in his seemingly sentient new plane, &quot;Birdie&quot;, helped the Allies during World War II.\n\nAirboy confronted such weird antagonists as intelligent rats, the mysterious Misery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whose Airtomb imprisoned the souls of dead pilots Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and his cleavage-baring Nazi archnemesis, Valkyrie, a German aviatrix who later became his ally.\n\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, David Nelson II continued to work as a freelance pilot and mercenary for a time, but he eventually retired from combat flying and stored Birdie in a barn outside his California estate. He had a son, whom he named David Nelson III, and founded an aircraft manufacturing company, through which he became very wealthy. In the mid-1980s, David Nelson II was assassinated by mercenaries from the South American nation of Bogantilla. When David Nelson III discovered that his father had been assassinated, he began to investigate the circumstances which had led up to his father's death. He soon discovered his father's mothballed plane and uniform and teamed up with a number of the surviving Air Fighters to face many of the same enemies as David Nelson II, as well as South American dictators, Soviets, pirates and corporate criminals.\n\nThis torrent contains issues 1-50, 'Air Fighters Classics' 1-6 reprinting Golden Age adventures, mini-series for 'Skywolf' and 'Valkyrie', various one-shots and the two issues of 'Airfighters with Airboy' published by Moonstone in 2010.
