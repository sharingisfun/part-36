He found it hard to relate to the troubles of his world. Fred got angry and built a ship called Spacecraft 11. He then launched himself into orbit around his planet. It was here that he reflected on his life experiences. He began to examine inner vs. outer space. He became aware of how his individual struggle could be related to his world's struggle at large. Fred was beginning to make a universal breakthrough. It was at this point the controllers came to intercept his space craft\n\n Clayton Ballard - Lead Vocals\n\n Antony De Gennaro - Guitars, Bass, Back Vocals, Sound Effects, Producer\n\n Hugh Sutton - Keyboards, Accordion, Back Vocals, Sound Effects, Producer\n\n Mike Stone - Drums and Percussion\n\n Brian Nelson - Recording, Mixing &amp; Mastering\n\n Harvey Ward Van Allen II - Voice of the Controller, Back Vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4d1668fd8a2473df20705394e3761614408348","amp;dn":"Asteroid+Park+-+Asteroid+Park+%282013%29+Album+%40+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4d1668fd8a2473df20705394e3761614408348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,77,22,104,253,138,36,115,223,32,112,83,148,227,118,22,20,64,131,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
