While your main vehicle is a helicopter, you also get to pilot a few vehicles that aren&amp;#039;t helicopters. Along with the array of choppers, you can also pilot harriers, tanks, and hovercrafts. It&amp;#039;s still the same premise (search, destroy, and rescue), but it&amp;#039;s nice to be able to control more than one type of aircraft. The fighting takes place in a variety of exotic locations, including Russia, America, and the Middle East. It also includes some of the best FMV movies of its day, which help to advance the plot. This was one of the longest running and most popular series of the PlayStation&amp;#039;s early days. \n\n\n\nType.................: Game RIP\n\nPlatform.............: PS1\n\nMore Info............: http://psx.ign.com/objects/002/002140.html\n\nPart Size............: 59.7 Mb\n\nNumber of Parts......: 1\n\nCompression Format...: 7Z\n\nImage Format.........: .bin\n\nImage Created with...: CloneCD\n\nBurn Tested..........: Yes\n\nCopy Protection......: nope \n\nPublished by.........: Electronic Arts\n\nDeveloped by.........: Electronic Arts\n\nGenre................: Action\n\nNumber of Players....: 1\n\nRelease Date.........:September 1, 1997 \n\nAlso Available On....: Nintendo 64, PC \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39735de7d226f3ffd225737e96ff223f9f03bcb9","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Strike-PAL+PS1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39735de7d226f3ffd225737e96ff223f9f03bcb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,115,93,231,210,38,243,255,210,37,115,126,150,255,34,63,159,3,188,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
