The contributors address issues and theories that define the field of psychology for its practitioners, researchers, and theorists. Focusing on a wide range of topics, including cognitive science, family therapy, psychoanalytic technique, psychotherapy versus psychopharmacology, gender and sexuality, psychology of religion, psycholinguistics, and cultural diversity, this book makes an important contribution to the understanding of the radically innovative character and complexity of Lacanian theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1175e39ca84e0c9e46f3c3e3ca270982a7b11d","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1999%5D+The+Subject+of+Lacan+A+Lacanian+Reader+for+Psycholo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1175e39ca84e0c9e46f3c3e3ca270982a7b11d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,17,117,227,156,168,78,12,158,70,243,195,227,202,39,9,130,167,177,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
