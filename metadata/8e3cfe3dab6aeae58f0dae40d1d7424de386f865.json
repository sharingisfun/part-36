From that day forward his life became an agony of irrepressible tics and involuntary utterances. Cory embarked on a fifteen-year odyssey of medication upon medication, treatment upon treatmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“a constantly changing regimen that left him and his family feeling like guinea pigs in an out-of-control experiment. It soon became unclear which tics were symptoms of his condition and which were side effects of the countless combinations of drugs. The only certainty was that it kept getting worse. Simply put: Cory Friedman's life was a living hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3cfe3dab6aeae58f0dae40d1d7424de386f865","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+-+Against+Medical+Advice+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3cfe3dab6aeae58f0dae40d1d7424de386f865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,60,254,61,171,106,234,229,143,13,174,64,209,215,66,77,227,134,248,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
