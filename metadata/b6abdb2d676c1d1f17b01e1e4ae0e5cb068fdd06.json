But resisting the bad-boy that\nis so off limits might be more than she can manage. He's one of those\nguys you just know isn't good for you Ã¢â‚¬â€œhe canÃ¢â‚¬â€œand often doesÃ¢â‚¬â€œhave\nany girl he wants.\n\nThe deeper she gets involved in a troubling field assignment, the more\nshe finds herself relying on Colt. If she can just figure out how to do the\nright thing and not fall for irritatingly hot Colt in the process, life can go\nback to normal. Baby steps.\n\n\n\nIn Too Deep (In Too Deep #1)\nBy Eliza Jane\nLanguage: EN\nPages: PDF 819 - EPUB 382","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6abdb2d676c1d1f17b01e1e4ae0e5cb068fdd06","amp;dn":"In+Too+Deep+-+Jane%2C+Eliza","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6abdb2d676c1d1f17b01e1e4ae0e5cb068fdd06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,171,219,45,103,108,29,31,23,176,30,30,74,224,229,203,6,143,221,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
