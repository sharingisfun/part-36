It includes a keygen with working keys.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nDesciption:\n\nNorton AntiBot, developed by Symantec, monitors applications for damaging behavior. The application was designed to prevent computers from being hijacked and controlled by hackers. According to Symantec, over 6 million computers have been hijacked, and the majority of users are unaware of their computers.\n\nAntiBot was designed to be used in conjunction with other antivirus software. Unlike traditional antivirus products, AntiBot does not use signatures; there is a delay between when a vendor discovers a virus and distributes the signature. During the delay, computers can be affected. Instead, AntiBot attempts to identify a virus through its actions; viruses are malicious by nature. However, AntiBot was not intended to replace an antivirus product. The program uses technology licensed from Sana Security.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d5f54f62b4220bcfcfd9d69a1562d5aced5a8b","amp;dn":"Norton+Antibot+%2B+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57d5f54f62b4220bcfcfd9d69a1562d5aced5a8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,213,245,79,98,180,34,11,207,207,217,214,154,21,98,213,172,237,90,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
