In the second half of the show Max talks to Satyajit Das, author of Extreme Money, about the European debt crisis, how much longer Germany can stay solvent and whether German banks would have survived if the Irish taxpayer had not bailed them out in the first place. \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
