His ability of manipulating sound and composition has stemmed from his 10 years of music production and this style of sound that Archaic has created has been influenced from his love of nature and shamanism, and from his many years in the music industry, stemming back through his early years involved in the indie and Punk scene, through the Goa era, up to this present day. His music has evolved greatly through out his time in Wildthings and this has brought him ever increasing international success and acclaim in the underground scene. He has been playing at many parties and festivals through out Europe, tuning people into this Wild shamanic digital sound he loves.\nEnjoy Sonic Driving, produced in the Greek mountains by Kostas Kanlis for dance floors and ears worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3690edb1f2501dcf4b79d57d8f9d695382ad253a","amp;dn":"Archaic+-+Sonic+Driving+-+2011+%5BPsychedelic+Trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3690edb1f2501dcf4b79d57d8f9d695382ad253a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,144,237,177,242,80,29,207,75,121,213,125,143,157,105,83,130,173,37,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
