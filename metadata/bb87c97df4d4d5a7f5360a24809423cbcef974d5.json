In simple, straightforward terms, Dr. Pimsleur will help you learn grammar (seamlessly), vocabulary, and how to practice pronunciation (and come out sounding like a native).\n\nThe key is the simplicity and directness of PimsleurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach to a daunting subject, breaking it down piece by piece, demystifying the process along the way. Dr. Pimsleur draws on his own language learning trials and tribulations offering practical advice for overcoming the obstacles so many of us face.\n\nOriginally published in 1980, How to Learn a Foreign Language is now available on the 50th anniversary of Dr. PimsleurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s publication of the first of his first audio courses that embodied the concepts and methods found here. It's a fascinating glimpse into the inner workings of the mind of this amazing pioneer of language learning.\n\n\nNote(s):\n\n1.
