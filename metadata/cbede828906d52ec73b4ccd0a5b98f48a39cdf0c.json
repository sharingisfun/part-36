Part 1.\n                New three-part crime drama by Lynda La Plante. Film\n                star Amanda Delany has the world at her feet. The\n                tabloids cannot get enough of her and she in turn\n                cannot get enough of the spotlight. Then, when she\n                arrives home late one evening from a night shoot,\n                Amanda puts the key in her front door for the last\n                time. The next morning, the press gathers on her\n                doorstep - but this time the journalists are\n                reporting on her brutal murder. DI Anna Travis is\n                shocked by what she finds out about the actress -\n                especially the truth behind Amanda's glamorous public\n                image. For all her fame and fortune, it seems Amanda\n                Delany was lonely, damaged and afraid. Can the team\n                work out whether jealous friends, jilted lovers or\n                scorned wives were capable of her murder?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbede828906d52ec73b4ccd0a5b98f48a39cdf0c","amp;dn":"Above.Suspicion.S04E01.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbede828906d52ec73b4ccd0a5b98f48a39cdf0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,237,232,40,144,109,82,236,115,180,204,208,165,185,143,72,163,156,223,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
