In homage to his perceived chances of commercial success, he named his band Slim Chance. Most songs on this album were written by Lane, the rest of Slim Chance, and Kate Lambert, his wife. Haunting, profound, and witty, the album did not exceed his commercial expectations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009b3845683081486ba4b702b76874ae87efdc7d","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Lane%27s+Slim+Chance+%281974%29+MP3%40320kps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009b3845683081486ba4b702b76874ae87efdc7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,155,56,69,104,48,129,72,107,164,183,2,183,104,116,174,135,239,220,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
