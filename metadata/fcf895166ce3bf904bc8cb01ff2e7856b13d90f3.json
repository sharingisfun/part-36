But Kelly Warren says it was murder--and she has new evidence that she believes proves it. Detective Cole Taylor doesn't put much credence in her claim, and nothing in his case review suggests foul play. But when Kelly ends up in the emergency room with a suspicious life-threatening medical condition, the incident strikes him as more than just coincidence. Digging deeper, he discovers she's linked to a long-ago crime. Is history repeating itself? And who wants Kelly silenced?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcf895166ce3bf904bc8cb01ff2e7856b13d90f3","amp;dn":"+Irene+Hannon-Lethal+Legacy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcf895166ce3bf904bc8cb01ff2e7856b13d90f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,248,149,22,108,227,191,144,75,200,203,1,255,46,120,86,177,61,144,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
