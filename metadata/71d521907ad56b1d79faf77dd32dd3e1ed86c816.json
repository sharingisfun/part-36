Goode\n\nNotes: \n\nThe AUD speed was increased on average by 1% to match the soundboard. \n\nThere are occasional gaps in both the AUD and SBD, so there will be instances where only one source is \nplaying. The SBD has more cuts in it, particularly between songs. \n\nThere is a second AUD source patched into Sugar Magnolia from 1:40 to 2:50, it seems.\n\nThe Low Gain of the SBD was increased by 3 dB.\n\nThe SBD can sound a little scratchy during some loud parts, which may be the result of the technical \ndifficulties they were having in Set I. (Not due to Gain adjust)\n\nThe transition between disc 2 and 3 is seamless.\n\nFor mysterious purposes only, an echo effect was added to the 30 second bit of noodling before I Need \na Miracle.\n\nThe results of this matrix are pretty darn good - enjoy this amazing Iowa Dead!
