For this purpose IHU is\n  compatible with ALSA, now the default Linux sound architecture,\n  but also with JACK, a low latency sound server. For the audio\n  compression, IHU uses Speex, a codec optimized for speech (and\n  completely free and open source).\n\n* Crypted stream: you have also the possibility to Encrypt/Decrypt\n  the stream using a fast hybrid cryptographic system\n  (RSA + Blowfish).\n\n* Command-line support: the GUI is not strictly necessary, you can\n  run also a textual IHU from command-line (for example if you need\n  to run the program on remote computers).\n\n* Free and Open Source: IHU is totally free and distributed under\n  the terms of GNU General Public License.\n\nThe possibilities of use of IHU are endless, for example you can use\nit like a phone to talk with your friends all around the world, or\nat home/work, to talk between computers in the LAN (talkback), etc.\n\n\nAUTHORS\n\nMatteo Trotta &lt;mtrotta (at) userssourceforgenet&gt;\nAuthor will be pleased to receive any comments, bugs, advices.\n\n\nWINDOWS\n\nIHU on Windows?
