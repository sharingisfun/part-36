There are significant contributions from people who worked alongside Duane, including studio engineers Howard and Ron Albert, members of the Muscle Shoals rhythm section, Hour Glass members Pete Carr and Paul Hornsby, and road manager Willie Perkins, along with a bevy of notable journalists and historians (and even excerpts from a taped interview with Skydog himself). Although the film emphasizes DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in originating Southern Rock, it provides enough insights into his career and guitar playing, historical footage, cool photos, and plausible anecdotal stories to make it a worthwhile expenditure of 131 minutes.\n\nA Sexy Intellectual Production (UK), 2013\n\nCodec: MS MPEG-4 Video v3 (mp43)\nResolution: 720X480\nFrame Rate: 29.9700\nDecoded Format: Planar 4:2:0  YUV\n\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 1/2/3 (mpga)\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz\nBitrate: 128 Kb/s\n\n\nRipped with Ideal DVD Copy, ver. 4.3.0\nConverted with Aimersoft Video Convertor Ultimate, v. 4.1.0\n\nScreen shots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MapGLAAFN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MapGLAAFN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mApGMAAFN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mApGMAAFN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaPGnAAfn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaPGnAAfn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MapGPaAfn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MapGPaAfn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NaPgAaAfn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NaPgAaAfn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NAPgBaAfn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NAPgBaAfn&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c157c33266b35e05b098fb1125867b86752ce4cb","amp;dn":"Song+of+the+South.+avi+-+Duane+Allman+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c157c33266b35e05b098fb1125867b86752ce4cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,87,195,50,102,179,94,5,176,152,251,17,37,134,123,134,117,44,228,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
