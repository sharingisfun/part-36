All are digitally re-mastered, with rare and previously unreleased bonus material supplementing each release.\n\n\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (40th Anniversary Edition)\n\nWritten by El Bicho\n\n\nIn honor of the 40th anniversary of their debut album, Fantasy Records is releasing the six studio albums of the band as a quartet. No word yet of their final album, Mardi Gras, which found lead guitarist John Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford as a trio after rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty quit.\n\nReleased in 1968 Creedence Clearwater Revival is a brief introduction to the band with eight songs coming in at almost 34 minutes. They play music that evokes genres associated with the South, which is surprising when revealed that they come from San Francisco, a scene awash in psychedelia at the time. They were a roots rock band, steeped in American music traditions, long before the term was used.\n\nThe album opens with a cover of ScreaminÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Jay Hawkins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Put A Spell On You.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The music and JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wailing vocal retain some of the eerie mood of the original. Also, JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar solos are fantastic coming out the left speaker, whether stretching out the notes or strumming at a blistering pace with Tom joining in on the latter. As I soak them in on repeated listens, I realize he is a much better player than I or anyone I remember ever gave him credit for on the strength of this performance alone.\n\nA radio edit of their cover of Dale HawkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSusie QÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was their first big hit and reached as high as #11 on the Pop charts, but the album cut is fantastic. Coming in at over eight minutes, the influences of the San Francisco scene are evident as the band stretches out with John soloing out of the right speaker and the band just chugging along nicely out the left.\n\nAside from those two classic rock staples, the remaining songs on the album are not as well known and reveal a band trying different musical ideas as they seek their identity. The Creedence signature sound hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t coalesced yet, but you can hear the elements forming. The third cover on the album is of Stax Records artist Wilson PickettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNinety-Nine And A HalfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as the boys head east on US 40 to interpret some Memphis soul. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Working ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an upbeat blues rock tune filtered a through a bit of Cream. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet Down WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“50s feel with lyrics that could have been sung by Elvis. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGloomyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finds the boys going psychedelic with the sound effects of a clock and using the studio to manipulate the guitar similar to The BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTomorrow Never Knows.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nThere are two songs from their previous incarnation as The Golliwogs. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPorterville,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the first CCR single and coincidentally the last single by the Golliwogs, with its jangly guitar and background vocals sounds like The Byrds and The Beatles circa 1965. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk On The WaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a remake of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalking On The Water.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Similar to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGloomy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it finds the band again playing with studio effects to augment the song.\n\nThe 40th anniversary edition of Creedence Clearwater Revival features four bonus tracks, two from the studio and two live. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCall It PretendingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was the B-side of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPorterville.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It has much more of a Motown R&amp;B sound. A cover of Bo DiddleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBefore You Accuse MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was recorded during their first studio date and would be rerecorded for CosmoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Factory. The two live tracks, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Ninety-Nine And a HalfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSusie Q,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are taken from a 3/14/69 performance at the Fillmore in San Francisco, which was recorded for radio station KSAN. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSusie QÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gets extended over eleven minutes. The extra time allows John to stretch out on his guitar, venturing into ragged and rugged terrain one usually finds Neil Young. The band, particularly CliffordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drums, keeps an intense rhythm going. The audience voices their approval at the conclusion.\n\nBen Fong-Torres provides new liner notes reminiscing about the album and the band. The back of the album is recreated, but the white words on the black and white photo are hard to make out, but I am pretty sure Ralph J. Gleason must have had good things to say about the band and its debut. I know I do.\n\n\n01 I Put a Spell on You\n02 The Working Man\n03 Suzie Q\n04 Ninety-Nine and a Half\n05 Get Down Woman\n06 Porterville\n07 Gloomy\n08 Walking on the Water\n09 Call It Pretending (B-side) [bonus track]\n10 Before You Accuse Me (Bo Diddley cover; 1968 outtake) [bonus track]\n11 Ninety-Nine and a Half (Live at the Fillmore, San Francisco, CA, 3/14/69) [bonus track]\n12 Suzie Q (Live at the Fillmore, San Francisco, CA, 3/14/69) [bonus track]\n\n\n\n\n\n    * John Fogerty - lead vocals, lead guitar, harmonica, keyboards, saxophone\n    * Tom Fogerty - rhythm guitar, backing vocals, piano\n    * Stu Cook - bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards\n    * Doug Clifford - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:652f1ea3ce3afe2c86e7e2acdb0000a10227ad5f","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival-Creedence+Clearwater+Revival%281968%29%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"652f1ea3ce3afe2c86e7e2acdb0000a10227ad5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,47,30,163,206,58,254,44,134,231,226,172,219,0,0,161,2,39,173,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
