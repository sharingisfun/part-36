Find out in this sparkling debut from Mhairi McFarlane.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThink of the great duos of history. We're just like them.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœYou mean like Kylie and Jason? Torvill and Dean? Sonny and Cher?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœI think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve missed the point, Rachel.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nRachel and Ben. Ben and Rachel. It was them against the world. Until it all fell apart. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a decade since they last spoke, but when Rachel bumps into Ben one rainy day, the years melt away.\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been partners in crime and the best of friends. But life has moved on: Ben is married. Rachel is not. Yet in that split second, Rachel feels the old friendship return. And along with it, the broken heart sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been able to mend.\n\nHilarious, heartbreaking and everything in between, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be hooked from their first Ã¢â‚¬ËœhelloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nMhairi was born in Scotland in 1976 and has been explaining how to pronounce her name ever since. (With a 'V', not an 'M'. Yes, that's us crazy Celts for you). She is based in Nottingham where she used to be a local journalist and now she's a freelance writer and sometime-blogger, which we all know is code for messing about on Twitter. She likes drinking wine, eating food and obtaining clothes; all the impressive hobbies. Her best anecdotes involve dislocating her elbow tripping over a briefcase and a very bad flight to New York. She lives with a man and a cat.\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.  Please check your Bit-Torrent client for the true number of seeds.
