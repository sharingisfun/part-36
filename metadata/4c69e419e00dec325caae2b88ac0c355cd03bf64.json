Here are a few examples:\n\nBrowse with Google Chrome, or Firefox with Flash AND Java support. Many websites don't work on iPad, iPhone, or even on Android because of Flash, Java or similar website features that rely on Ã¢â‚¬Å“PC-classÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ browsers. Now you can use those same browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox right from your iPad, iPhone or Android device. For example:\n\nAccess the Chrome Web Store, with tons of apps (like Picnik photo editor, or Evony or Runescape). Synchronize your browsing with your home PC\nYou can play Facebook Flash games on your iPad or iPhone, Access Quickbooksonline.com, or edit websites using Google Sites and many other systems that don't work on iOS Safari\nInstall Firefox Add-ons and plug-ins and toolbars just like you can on your computer...\nFirefox with Flash player: It works great for all your favorite websites that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work on mobile browsers, such as Facebook games, kids games like Club Penguin or WebKinz, real money poker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ any site that requires Flash.

Easily load files from your PC or Mac to your AlwaysOnPC and access them *anytime* from your iPhone.\nDropbox Online storage / Backup file access: If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re one of the millions of people using an online storage/backup service for your PC/Mac documents, you can probably use it to access docs from your smartphone or iPad using AlwaysOnPC! For example, we provide the DropboxÃ¢â€žÂ¢ client software pre-installed &amp; ready to use. Simply double-click the link on the desktop to launch the application. If you are already a Dropbox user, just login and your files are sync'ed in moments! If you are not already registered, click the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Register/Get an AccountÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ link and follow the instructions to sign up (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free for up to 2Gb of storage!)

You can do all the powerful features you probably don't miss Ã¢â‚¬â€œuntil you leave with just your smartphone. Here are a few examples:\n\nBlazing-fast open &amp; save performance on WiFi or 3G: Since AlwaysOnPC is actually running Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the cloudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, your documents open super-fast from email and online storage. In tests, an 8 Mb spreadsheet or 5 Mb PDF file open in well under a minute using AlwaysOnPC, but took over 5 minutes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or errored out - using the competing viewers. Especially useful for large documents.\nTrue multi-tasking: Just like your PC, you can run multiple applications Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example run FireFox or Flash sites in multiple windows or tabs, while at the same time have several Word, Excel, and Powerpoint docs open in Open Office all at the same time. Copy/paste images, text between them. Switch apps quickly and easily (like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alt-TabÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on a PC) using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“three finger-swipeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gesture.\nPrivate web browsing/anonymous surfing*: None of your private data, visited URLs, IP address or content are ever passed over the network or visible to anyone, unlike typical remote VNC apps - GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, WebEx -where your computer and its contents could be exposed.\nRock-solid security: All connections with AlwaysOnPC are encrypted for your privacy and security.\nAccess anywhere: In addition to your iPhone or iPod touch, you can access AlwaysOnPC anytime, anywhere, from any computer or Internet kiosk - Mac, PC or Linux (and soon Android!).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kickass.to/alwaysonpcchrome-java-v2-7-1-satfoun-amrg-apk-t7691230.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kickass.to/alwaysonpcchrome-java-v2-7-1-satfoun-amrg-apk-t7691230.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c69e419e00dec325caae2b88ac0c355cd03bf64","amp;dn":"AlwaysOnPCChrome%2CJava+v2.7.1+%5BSatfoun%5D+%7BAMRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c69e419e00dec325caae2b88ac0c355cd03bf64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,105,228,25,224,13,236,50,92,170,226,184,138,192,195,85,205,3,191,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
