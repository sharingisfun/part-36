Based on Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, this somber period drama stars a suitably intense Christopher Eccleston as Jude, a young man with dreams of receiving a scholarly university education. Circumstances conspire against him, however, forcing him into a job as a stonemason and an unsatisfactory marriage. He remains true to his dream, however, and years later, after his wife's sudden departure, heads for the city. There he encounters his beautiful cousin, Sue (Kate Winslet), who shares his intelligence and disdain for convention, and the two develop a romantic relationship. These unlikely lovers must struggle to keep their relationship secret from a disapproving world, however, or else face the tragic consequences of public scandal. Though purists may object to several liberties taken with the text, director Michael Winterbottom fashions a relatively efficient tale of doomed romance from Hardy's tragedy. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Jude.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 701 MiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 2mn\n      Bit rate : 792 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 14.8 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 5\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 2mn\n      Bit rate : 668 Kbps\n      Width : 560 pixels\n      Height : 240 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.205\n      StreamSize : 585 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 2h 2mn\n      Bit rate : 115 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 101 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: /tt0116722\n\nEnglish audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8bf4157b42ff796a086025a2aa84f8c3d131120","amp;dn":"Jude+%281996%29+-+Michael+Winterbottom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8bf4157b42ff796a086025a2aa84f8c3d131120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,191,65,87,180,47,247,150,160,134,2,90,42,168,79,140,61,19,17,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
