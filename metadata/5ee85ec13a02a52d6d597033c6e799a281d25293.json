Here Comes Everybody is a memoir written by founding member and accordion player James Fearnley, drawn from his personal experiences and the series of journals and correspondence he kept throughout the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. \n\nFearnley describes the coalescence of a disparate collection of vagabonds living in the squats of LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kings Cross, with, at its center, the charismatic MacGowan and his idea of turning Irish traditional music on its head. With beauty, lyricism, and great candor, Fearnley tells the story of how the band watched helplessly as their singer descended into a dark and isolated world of drugs and alcohol, and sets forth the increasingly desperate measures they were forced to take.\n\nGenre: Music related","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee85ec13a02a52d6d597033c6e799a281d25293","amp;dn":"Here+Comes+Everybody%3A+The+Story+of+the+Pogues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee85ec13a02a52d6d597033c6e799a281d25293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,232,94,193,58,2,165,45,109,89,112,51,198,231,153,162,129,210,82,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
