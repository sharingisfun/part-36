(47 levels plus bonus content.)\n* Confront attractors, repulsors and intelligent motes with similar abilities and goals as you.\n* Procedural content: play random versions of any level.\n* Sublime electronic soundtrack by Loscil, Gas/High Skies, Julien Neto, Biosphere, and more.\n* 11 glorious achievements, now integrated with Game Center.\n* Dynamic time-warping: slow down the flow of time to outmaneuver agile opponents; speed it up to raise the challenge.\n\nAccolades:\n* Winner of the IGF D2D Vision award.\n* Winner of the &quot;Best in Show&quot; and &quot;Fun/Compelling&quot; awards at IndieCade.\n* Independent Games Festival finalist in three categories: Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Excellence in Design and Technical Excellence\n* Selected as one of the 2009 PAX 10\n* ...and chosen by many websites in their best-of-year lists.\n\nReviews:\n&quot;a beautiful, absorbing experienceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ brilliant to look atÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the best videogame music I've heardÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ will make you forget your cares and immerse you in the gameÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ you'll find yourself returning for the experience.&quot; -- EditorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice Award, IGN\n\n&quot;wonderful gameplayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ beautifully polished and tantalizingly atmosphericÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Osmos mixes puzzle, action and strategy remarkably and all the while does it with great finesse and style.&quot; -- indiegames.com\n\n&quot;beyond doubt, a work of genius... a relaxing, meditative experience about going with the flow...
