According to Pirenne, it was only in the mid-seventh century that the characteristic features of classical life disappeared from Europe, after which time the continent began to develop its own distinctive and somewhat primitive medieval culture.\n\nFor Scott, archaeology demonstrated that the Arabs did indeed blockade the Mediterranean through piracy and slave-raiding, precisely as Pirenne had claimed, and he argues that the disappearance of papyrus from Europe was an infallible proof of this. Whatever classical learning survived after this time, says Scott, was due almost entirely to the efforts of Christian monks.\n\nAuthor: Emmet Scott\nPublisher: New English Review Press\nPublication Date: January 15, 2012\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a474e2f97f610cee03e04cd70b79d4f2cf4e5df","amp;dn":"Emmet+Scott+-+Mohammed+and+Charlemagne+Revisited+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a474e2f97f610cee03e04cd70b79d4f2cf4e5df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,71,78,47,151,246,16,206,224,62,4,205,112,183,157,79,44,244,229,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
