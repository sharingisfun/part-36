The original trilogy, The Lost King, King's Test and King's Sacrifice, concerns Dion's adventures and eventual rise to the throne. A few years later, Margaret Weis realized that, while Dion had achieved his goals, the main characters of the series (sundered lovers Sagan and Maigrey) had not achieved peace, and penned the fourth book, Ghost Legion.\r\n\r\nShe has since completed a trilogy of spin-offs concerning the mercenary team Mag Force 7 introduced in King's Sacrifice. Based originally on The Magnificent Seven, the team developed a much more varied membership just in time to star in their own novels: The Knights of the Black Earth, Robot Blues and Hung Out. Later,[when?] when Weis and Don Perrin began to develop collectible card games, they used the phrase &quot;Mag Force 7&quot; as the title of their company.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nStar of the Guardians (EPUB)\r\n\r\n1.
