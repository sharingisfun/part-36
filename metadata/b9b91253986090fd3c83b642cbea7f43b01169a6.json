With more than 140 miles of track between Roseville and Reno and the dramatic Sierra Nevada landscape of the Donner Pass itself, there are hours of pleasure to be had driving through this incredible part of North America.\n\nThe first railroad through the Sierra Nevada mountains was opened by the Central Pacific Railroad way back in the 1860s, the culmination of a significant engineering challenge with a combination of tunnel-building and tough weather high in the mountains causing numerous problems for the Chief Engineer and his team. The line has changed ownership over the years, and different operators have chopped and changed the track layout and tunnel system in the Donner Pass region in order to keep maintenance costs manageable whilst keeping the railroad operational throughout the seasons.\n\nDonner Pass: Southern Pacific puts you at the controls of Southern Pacific diesels in the early-1990s, taking trains between Roseville, California and Reno, Nevada through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and high up through the incredible 7,000-foot Donner Pass. The trains are heavy, the railroad is tough and the scenery is awesome. So, start the motor, you have some real challenges ahead...\n\nIncludes:\n140+ mile railroad line between Roseville Yard, California and Reno, Nevada including the world-famous Donner Pass.\n\n5 diesel locomotives in early 1990s-era Southern Pacific livery:\nSW1500 Diesel Switcher\nGP9 Diesel Locomotive\nSD40-2 Diesel Locomotive\nSD40T-2 Diesel Locomotive ('Tunnel Motor')\nC44-9W Diesel Locomotive\nScenarios:\n\n5 Free roam scenarios:\n\nColfax Depot\nTruckee Yard\nSparks Yard\nDonner Pass\nRoseville Yard\n7 Standard/Career scenarios:\n\nDoing it Right: Switching freight cars at Roseville Yard\nGet Involved: Helping a heavy train over Donner Pass\nTogether as One: Rescuing a failed train\nCold Play: Inspection of the line in winter\nUnder Pressure: Drive a heavy train over Donner Pass / weather condition 1\nGrade Crossing: Drive a heavy train over Donner Pass / weather condition 2\n\nHow to Install:\n\nTrain Simulator 2012\nSet the selected files.
