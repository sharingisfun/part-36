And that is it. So if you were hoping for a little more background on this trio (or is it a duo?), no can doÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nMusically we are talking about traditional metal, deeply rooted in the 80s, but sounding like the 10s, managing to take in themselves not really original riffs and song structures and making them sound so good, though, that you could not care less, but just want to continue whipping yourself into an old school frenzy you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to stop! Ancient EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach to the genre is very no-frills, but that is part of what makes it so endearing to the ears of any connoisseur of the traditional steel, with JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mid-pitched voice, the strong riff orientation, power, urgency and still latent epic melodic-ness all coming together on When Empires Fall.\n\nWithout an intro the Californians jump right into the fray with a potent 1-2 punch in the form of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shadow of the CrossÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wings of SteelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with strong riffs, good drive, tight performance and JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal delivery paving the way for the album to take you for a ride. What makes LisztÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice so well-suited is that it is very melodic, but just with the right amount of grit to add that extra bit of power to help propel the songs forward. And no matter if more mid-paced (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Valley of SlaughterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or with speedy outbursts (Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the Killing FieldsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or energetic and riffy such as the band hymn Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ancient EmpireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, When Empires Fall with all of its relative straightness and straightforward approach never gets one-dimensional and this is where the true class comes through.\nWhile some of the songs fall off a little, When Empires Fall is a great debut that combines the spirit of the 80s with the sound of the 10s and delivers a great deal of energy, drive and also maturity (mostly in the melodies) that shows that this is not a green band by any way. If you crave some great old-fashioned but not outdated metal, Ancient Empire is the way to go!\n\n\n\nLine-up:\nRich Pelletier - ???\nJoe Liszt - guitar, bass and Vocals\nSteve Pelletier  - Drums\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nWhen Empires Fall  (2014)\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
