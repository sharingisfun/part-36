The band even admits in the liner notes that they were using marijuana while creating this music. However, no matter how bizarre it gets, there manages to be an element of fun running throughout. The band makes extensive use of the tape manipulation technique which was used by Zappa in 1967, and even earlier by 20th Century composers like Stockhausen and possible others. The cut-and-paste technique employed here makes the music sound strange, but it doesn't take away the bizarre charm this music possesses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc26a14c2f1420c5a7ac2e7361336a36992e1740","amp;dn":"Faust+-+Faust+%2F+So+Far+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc26a14c2f1420c5a7ac2e7361336a36992e1740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,38,161,76,47,20,32,197,167,172,46,115,97,51,106,54,153,46,23,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
