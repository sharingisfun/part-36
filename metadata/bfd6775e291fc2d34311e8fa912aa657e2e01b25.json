She moved to Los Angeles and began working as a private investigator at Grey's Detective Agency. But all of this is just a disguise; in fact she is a princess of faerie, her real name is Meredith Nic Essus, and she had to flee the Dark Court of Faerie because of attempts on her life.\n\nIn order to inherit her rightful crown, Merry needed to conceive an heir, a notoriously difficult task for the slow-reproducing Fey. In the 2009 novel Divine Misdemeanors, Merry had finally achieved that goal - and fans have been kept waiting all this time to find out what happens! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd6775e291fc2d34311e8fa912aa657e2e01b25","amp;dn":"Laurell+K.+Hamilton+-+Meredith+Gentry+Book+9+-+A+Shiver+of+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd6775e291fc2d34311e8fa912aa657e2e01b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,214,119,94,41,31,194,211,67,17,232,250,145,42,166,87,226,224,27,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
