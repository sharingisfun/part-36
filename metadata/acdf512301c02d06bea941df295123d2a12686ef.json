If you enjoy this album you might consider downloading their EP, Sounds of Love, which I have also uploaded.\n\nThe Morning Light, hailing from Pittsburgh, PA, make their debut, self-titled album a good one with this offering from September 2008 to follow up their EP, Sounds of Love.  Featuring upbeat melodies and a good amount of piano for the soul.  Hope you all can enjoy this album as I continue to do.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. Wake Up!\n2. Done Writing Love Songs\n3.
