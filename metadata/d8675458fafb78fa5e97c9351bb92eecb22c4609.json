Marcus (Wiley, 1998).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0-471-98369-1\r\n\r\nThe Properties of Solvents Yizhak Marcus Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel The Properties of Solvents contains extensively annotated tables of physical, chemical and related properties for over 250 solvents. Factual knowledge of solvent effects on solvation, solubility, chemical equilibria and reaction rate is important for theoretical and practical applications. This volume will enable chemists to choose solvents rationally, taking into account solvent properties and the expected results. The Properties of Solvents is a valuable source of information for all who are interested in the behaviour of solutions. These include solution, organic, analytical and physical chemists. Contents\r\n* Introduction\r\n* Solvent effects\r\n* Physical properties\r\n* Chemical properties\r\n* Applications\r\nThe Wiley Series in Solution Chemistry fills the increasing need to present authoritative, comprehensive and fully up-to-date accounts of the many aspects of solution chemistry. Internationally recognized experts from research or teaching institutions in various countries are invited to contribute to the series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8675458fafb78fa5e97c9351bb92eecb22c4609","amp;dn":"The+Properties+of+Solvents+-+Y.+Marcus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8675458fafb78fa5e97c9351bb92eecb22c4609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,103,84,88,250,251,120,250,94,151,201,53,27,185,46,236,178,44,70,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
