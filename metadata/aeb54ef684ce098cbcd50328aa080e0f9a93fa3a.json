Basically the same lineup as the &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; LP from \n\n1959, except Wynton Kelly does not participate.  That would be too much to ask \n\nfor.  Ripped via EAC.\n\n\nIt's fun to decide which &quot;horn&quot; is soloing while listening to these tracks.  Is it \n\nColtrane's tenor or &quot;cannonball's*&quot; alto.\n\n\n*Nicknamed cannibal/cannonball because of his prodigious appetite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb54ef684ce098cbcd50328aa080e0f9a93fa3a","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+sextet+1958+w%2FBill+Evans%2C+Coltrane%2C+Cannonball","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb54ef684ce098cbcd50328aa080e0f9a93fa3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,181,78,246,132,206,9,140,188,213,3,40,170,8,14,15,154,147,250,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
