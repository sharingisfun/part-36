Without immediate families that they can relate to, and lacking friends their own age, all they have is each other. Through a series of memories and vignettes, Ã¢â‚¬ËœJess + MossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recounts the events of the last summer they shared together. Shot entirely on location with a variety of expired and often degraded film stocks, Ã¢â‚¬ËœJess + MossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ captures the evocative and haunting character of the dark fire tobacco fields of rural Western Kentucky.\n\nJess and Moss 2011 DVDRiP XViD TASTE\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB Rating: 5.9/10 from 358 users Metascore: 71/100\nDirected by: Clay Jeter\nStarring: Marie Coleman, Donald R.
