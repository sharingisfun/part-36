Monteiro (ExLi4EvA, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThe study of radiation effects has developed as a major field of materials science from the beginning, approximately 70 years ago. Its rapid development has been driven by two strong influences. The properties of the crystal defects and the materials containing them may then be studied. The types of radiation that can alter structural materials consist of neutrons, ions, electrons, gamma rays or other electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths. All of these forms of radiation have the capability to displace atoms/molecules from their lattice sites, which is the fundamental process that drives the changes in all materials. The effect of irradiation on materials is fixed in the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. The book is distributed in four sections: Ionic Materials; Biomaterials; Polymeric Materials and Metallic Materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05bb9143825337ed6b8d7ea727acc34811d87cd","amp;dn":"Radiation+Effects+in+Materials+-+Waldemar+A.+Monteiro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05bb9143825337ed6b8d7ea727acc34811d87cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,91,185,20,56,37,51,126,214,184,215,234,114,122,204,52,129,29,135,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
