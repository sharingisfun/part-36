Tsutomu Yamazaki plays Goro, a truck driver who helps a young widow named Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) improve her noodle restaurant. Over the course of the film, the story drifts around, not only following the stories of Tampopo, her son, and Goro, but also a number of customers who come through the diner, including an old woman (Izumi Hara) who insists on squeezing the cheese at a market and a criminal (Ken Watanabe) with a food-based kink. Tampopo was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1988 Independent Spirit Awards.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish / French / Italian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19770242803183d27929a7d5b07f2032a8edeb6e","amp;dn":"Tampopo+1985+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19770242803183d27929a7d5b07f2032a8edeb6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,119,2,66,128,49,131,210,121,41,167,213,176,127,32,50,168,237,235,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
