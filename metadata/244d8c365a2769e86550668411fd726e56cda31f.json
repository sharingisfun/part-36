The song is a comedic, high camp dance track about the duplicitous title character who &quot;saw my man, so she felt the need to scratch her itch&quot;. There is a mild lyrical suggestion that the subject has had an overseas sex-change operation, though this must be inferred by the listener. The chorus is sung in Franglish and contains the double entendre &quot;Je suis oh-so-hot! Vous vu lay my twat, s'il vous plait?&quot;. The song was remixed for club play and was well received in gay venues, but fell short of being a &quot;hit&quot; in any popular sense.\n\nreview by Will Grega\n\nWith a gift for self-invention, this fiercest of drag divas constructs the myth and legend of Pussy Tourette while simultaneously deconstructing queer misconceptions. From the New Orleans Dr. John camp of &quot;If I Can't Sell It...&quot; to the gritty Led Zeppelin-influenced heavy blues of &quot;Free Pussy,&quot; it's clear that Ms. Tourette is not the girl next door. Tourette has a streetwise, gritty gift for blues-rock. &quot;French Bitch&quot; is an instant queer classic (the video has more slaps per minute than any other music video in history).\n\n01 - Bridgette\n02 - French Bitch\n03 - $70\n04 - Heels\n05 - If I Can't Sell It\n06 - Free Pussy\n07 - After You\n08 - Pussy's Boogie\n09 - Bracelets\n10 - I Think He's Gay\n11 - French Bitch (Sans Bad Words)\n\nFull liner note scans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244d8c365a2769e86550668411fd726e56cda31f","amp;dn":"Pussy+Tourette+-+In+Hi-Fi%21+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244d8c365a2769e86550668411fd726e56cda31f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,77,140,54,90,39,105,232,101,80,102,132,17,253,114,110,86,205,163,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
