In the first issue of the series, the new team consisted of Luke Cage, Victoria Hand, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Mockingbird, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, The Thing and Wolverine. Wolverine and Spider-Man will be operating on the main Avengers team as well as the New Avengers, and Doctor Strange accepts an offer to join the team after their first mission while he searches for the new Sorceror Supreme after the death of Doctor Voodoo. Daredevil joins the team in issue #16 after accepting an offer from Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. Jessica leaves the team for personal reasons and is later joined by Luke Cage, thus ending that iteration of the team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b9c7120f6a3843a7133e5ab78d03cbec8c1637","amp;dn":"New+Avengers+%2801+-+34+%26amp%3B+Annual%29+%28Megan-Empire%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b9c7120f6a3843a7133e5ab78d03cbec8c1637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,185,199,18,15,106,56,67,167,19,62,90,183,141,3,203,236,140,22,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
