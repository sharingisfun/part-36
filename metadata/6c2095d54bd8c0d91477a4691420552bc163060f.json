The real Santa Claus has fallen off his roof and his &quot;emergency card&quot; instructs Scott to take his place. But by putting on the Santa suit, Scott unknowingly accepts all the responsibilities of the rosy-cheeked legend. With his young son by his side, Scott starts a comical new life of weight gain, beard growth, narrow chimneys and elves with attitude!\n\nThe Santa Clause 2: Santa's got problems and things quickly go south when he finds out that his son, Charlie, has landed on this year's &quot;naughty&quot; list. Desperate to help his son, Scott heads back home, leaving a substitute Claus to watch over things at the Pole. But when the substitute redefines naughty and nice, putting Christmas at risk, it's up to Scott to return with a new bag of magic to try to save Christmas!\n\nThe Santa Clause 3:Tim Allen reprises his role of Scott Calvin-aka Santa as he juggles a full house of family and the mischievous Jack Frost (Martin Short), whose chilling Santa envy has him trying to take over the &quot;big guy's&quot; holiday.\nAt the risk of giving away its secret location, Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman (Ann-Margret and Alan Arkin) to the North Pole to share in the holiday festivities and be near their daughter, Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell)-aka Mrs. Claus- as she prepares for the eagerly anticipated birth of baby Claus.\n\n\n****************************************************************\nsource[orig dvd boxset\n\n****************************************************************\n\nencoded too:ac3 5.1 [where available]\n\n****************************************************************\ndvd 1 santa clause:\n\nFormat : AVI at 2 709 Kbps\nLength : 1.76 GiB for 1h 33mn 8s 768ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 314 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 552 (1.855) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************\ndvd 2 santa clause 2\n\nFormat : AVI at 2 800 Kbps\nLength : 1.96 GiB for 1h 40mn 6s 656ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 341 Kbps\nAspect : 702 x 552 (1.809) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************\ndvd 3 santa clause 3[the escape clause]\n\n\nFormat : AVI at 2 862 Kbps\nLength : 1.76 GiB for 1h 28mn 10s 0ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 467 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 552 (1.855) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2095d54bd8c0d91477a4691420552bc163060f","amp;dn":"The+Santa+Clause+Boxset+1-3+xvids+ac3+5.1+The_Stig%40Torrent+Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2095d54bd8c0d91477a4691420552bc163060f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,32,149,213,75,216,192,217,20,119,164,105,20,32,85,43,193,99,6,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
