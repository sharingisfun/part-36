Addie &quot;Sweet Pease&quot; Spivey is backed by a quartet with trumpeter Red Allen in 1929 on four numbers, and by a variety of Chicago-based musicians during 1936-37, while The Za Zu Girl (Elton Island Spivey) only had one four-song session. Both singers are somewhat limited but the backup musicians (which include trumpeter Lee Collins, pianist Althea Dickerson, and mandolinist Charley McCoy) uplift the music.
