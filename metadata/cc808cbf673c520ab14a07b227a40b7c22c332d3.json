And that's why I've not been sharing as much 2012 Christian music as perhaps I could be sharing.  But here's my second torrent in as many days, bringing the year to date count up to 1,358 titles for 2012.\n\nThere's lots of Christmas Music here today including All About Worship, Brian Wahl, Eleventyseven, Jason Bare, Jason Gray, Katherine Jenkins, and Scott Krippayne.  There's some Southern Gospel including Canton Junction and Tribute Quartet.  How about some Classical?  Noah Stewart. Jazz?  Charles P Walker.  Are you hoping for a nice instrumental? Philip Wesley has a beautiful piano instrumental.  And the list goes on.\n\nThis 51st bundle includes the following 30 releases...\n\n * All About Worship - 2012 - Christmas Collective\n * Andrew Greer - 2012 - Acoustic Cathedral EP, Vol 1\n * Brady Toops - 2012 - A Hymn Collection\n * Brian Wahl - 2012 - Christmas Acoustic EP\n * Canton Junction - 2012 - Canton Junction\n * Charles P Walker - 2012 - Life Changing - A Journey Called Grace\n * David Phelps - 2012 - Classic\n * Ed Kowalczyk - 2012 - The Garden EP\n * Eleventyseven - 2012 - Regifted EP\n * Greeley Estates - 2012 - The Narrow Road\n * Ivan Parker - 2012 - Timeless Treasures\n * Jason Bare - 2012 - What Child Is This - Single\n * Jason Gray - 2012 - Joy To The World - Single\n * Jeff And Sheri Easter - 2012 - Eyes Wide Open\n * John Tibbs - 2012 - Swallowing Death Breathing Life\n * Joy Electric - 2012 - Dwarf Mountain Alphabet\n * Katherine Jenkins - 2012 - Best Of British\n * Katherine Jenkins - 2012 - This Is Christmas\n * Kingdom Heirs, The - 2012 - Songs From The Red Book, Vol 3\n * Mike Mains And The Branches - 2012 - Home\n * Mozes - 2012 - Peace And Chainz\n * Noah Stewart - 2012 - Noah - US Version\n * Philip Wesley - 2012 - Hope Endures\n * Red - 2012 - Perfect Life - Single\n * Scott Krippayne - 2012 - O Holy Night - Single\n * Stria - 2012 - Stria EP\n * Talleys, The - 2012 - Love Won\n * Tim Martin - 2012 - The Narrow And Straight\n * Tina Jenkins Crawley - 2012 - The Longest Journey\n * Tribute Quartet - 2012 - Our Anthem\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - December 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc808cbf673c520ab14a07b227a40b7c22c332d3","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+51+of+51%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc808cbf673c520ab14a07b227a40b7c22c332d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,128,140,191,103,60,82,10,177,74,7,178,39,164,11,124,34,195,50,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
