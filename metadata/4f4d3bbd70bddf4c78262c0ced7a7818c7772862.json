Ronald Colman plays Hadji, &quot;king of beggars&quot; in the days of the Arabian Nights. Posing as a prince, Colman woos Marlene Dietrich, the favorite wife of the evil Wazir (Edward Arnold). Meanwhile, Colman's daughter Joy Ann Page falls in love with handsome Caliph James Craig--while the Wazir connives to get Page into his own harem. Several plot convolutions later, Colman ends up with Dietrich, Page winds up with Craig, and the Wazir winds up six feet under. Kismet was based on the war-horse stage play by Edward Knoblock, previously filmed in 1920 and 1930 with the play's original star Otis Skinner. The title Oriental Dream was bestowed upon the 1944 Kismet  when it was remade as a musical in 1955. The earlier version had its musical moments as well, notably a delicious dance number spotlighting Dietrich, painted gold head from head to toe; an additional dance sequence was cut, but later showed up in the Abbott and Costello comedy Lost in a Harem (1944). \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036984/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036984/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search2/sublanguageid-all/moviename-kismet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search2/sublanguageid-all/moviename-kismet&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:35:46\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x560  1.29:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1932 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f4d3bbd70bddf4c78262c0ced7a7818c7772862","amp;dn":"Kismet+%281944%29+Marlene+Dietrich+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f4d3bbd70bddf4c78262c0ced7a7818c7772862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,77,59,189,112,189,223,76,120,38,44,12,237,122,120,24,199,119,40,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
