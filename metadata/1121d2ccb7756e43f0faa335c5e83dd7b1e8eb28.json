In this unpredictable and often violent world, should they be more? Narratives and story lines converge as the past catches up with the present, and in quiet, unassuming Unalaska, USA, a new mission is forged.\n\n\nThis torrent includes both c2c and noAds versions.\n\n*Note: Each issue of this series in print form includes story-relevant bonus content, which enhances the story being told.  And not just sketch galleries and pinups.  These bonuses will NOT be included in the collected trade volumes, and are NOT available in the individual digital releases.  This release includes those bonuses.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1121d2ccb7756e43f0faa335c5e83dd7b1e8eb28","amp;dn":"The+Massive+03+%282+covers+with+Bonus+Content%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1121d2ccb7756e43f0faa335c5e83dd7b1e8eb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,33,210,204,183,117,110,67,240,250,163,53,197,232,61,215,177,232,235,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
