When George Darrow, a young American diplomat in Paris, is slighted by the woman he intends to propose marriage to, he has a brief, seemingly inconsequential affair with a spirited young woman whom he has taken under his wing. Months later, Darrow and the widowed Anna Leath mend their relationship and make plans to wed. But before they can announce their plans, Darrow learns that the engagement of Anna's stepson threatens to have a profound effect on his own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255b69a1041980251706ab0659a79ab5f5a8ae43","amp;dn":"Edith+Wharton%2C+The+Reef+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255b69a1041980251706ab0659a79ab5f5a8ae43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,91,105,161,4,25,128,37,23,6,171,6,89,167,154,181,245,168,174,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
