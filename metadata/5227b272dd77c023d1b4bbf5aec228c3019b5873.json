It does it in a fun way but it doesn't spoof the classic westerns in any way and it never becomes humorous or a parody that makes fun of the genre.\n\nWho would have known, Sharon Stone is a believable cowgirl. I think it's fair for me to say that she's the best I have seen in a western. The movie also features both Russell Crow and Leonardo DiCaprio before their days of fame and big Dollars. It's always fun and great to have Gene Hackman in a villain role and he makes this movie an even more pleasant watch. The movie features lot's of other fun and stereotype western characters.\n\nThe settings and costumes are great and real western like and help to create the right atmosphere for the movie. The great western score is by Alan Silvestri and fits the movie well, even though the score goes a bit too much &quot;Back to the Future&quot; like at times.\n\nThe movie is filled with some unusual but great Sam Raimi like cinematography and tricks.\n\nJust enjoy and don't pay attention to the story. It is just simple entertainment!\n\n8/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5227b272dd77c023d1b4bbf5aec228c3019b5873","amp;dn":"The+Quick+and+The+Dead+DVD+Rip%5B1995%5D0ptional_Norwegian_Subs.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5227b272dd77c023d1b4bbf5aec228c3019b5873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,39,178,114,221,119,192,35,209,180,187,245,174,194,40,195,1,155,88,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
