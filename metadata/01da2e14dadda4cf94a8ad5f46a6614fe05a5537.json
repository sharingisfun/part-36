This theory states that ethnic groups resemble large families whose members are prone to cooperate due to 'kin altruism'. Recent empirical findings in economics and political science offer confirmatory evidence. The book presents two separate studies that compare welfare expenditures around the world, both indicating that the more ethnically mixed a population becomes, the greater is its resistance to redistributive policies. These results point to profound inconsistencies within ideologies of both left and right regarding ethnicity.\n\n368 pages\nSeries: Routledge Studies in Nationalism and Ethnicity\nPublisher: Routledge (July 21, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0714654272\nISBN-13: 978-0714654270","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01da2e14dadda4cf94a8ad5f46a6614fe05a5537","amp;dn":"Welfare%2C+Ethnicity+%26amp%3B+Altruism+%282004%29+edited+by+Frank+Salter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01da2e14dadda4cf94a8ad5f46a6614fe05a5537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,218,46,20,218,221,164,207,148,168,173,95,70,166,97,79,224,90,85,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
