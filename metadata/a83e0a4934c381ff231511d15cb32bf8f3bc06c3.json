He was supposed to go with best friend Sarah, but she?s had less time and attention for him lately. Instead, he heads off by himself only to meet Anna, on the same errand.\n\nAnna?s the perfect outsider angel. In miniskirt, fishnets, and heavy boots, she breaks Miles out of his self-centered shell ? joking and flirting with him, explaining things about himself to him, and sharing his secret places. It?s clearly his story, with his emotions serving as the focal point, and we?ve seen her type of character before, the first love who inspires the man inside the boy.\n\nThe creators describe the book as ?a teenage love story ? for the person you once were? the sixteen year old that fell in love at first sight and took themselves all too seriously.? It?s a good summary. These lonely, disaffected kids have the wonder of finding a new world through each other. Their magical day will be a life-changing experience, if only in the memory, while the more experienced reader realizes how universal their experiences are. \n\nFrom: http://comicsworthreading.com/2006/01/20/a-strange-day/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a83e0a4934c381ff231511d15cb32bf8f3bc06c3","amp;dn":"A+Strange+Day+%28Comic+written+by+Damon+Hurd+%26+illustrated+by+Tati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a83e0a4934c381ff231511d15cb32bf8f3bc06c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,62,10,73,52,195,129,255,35,21,17,209,92,179,43,248,243,188,6,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
