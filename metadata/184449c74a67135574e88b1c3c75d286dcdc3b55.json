This is for everyone who thought Halloween didn't have it's own soundtrack (like Xmas does), I have put together this huge collection.  This is not everything, as more gets released all the time.  But I've scoured the internet and record stores to come up with this.  Lots of the music here is hard to find rare, and lots of this music here is from other CDs, compilations, from well known sources/artists.  Although the bit rates vary from song to song though.  it's like mostly 128 44.1 but a majority of the music is higher than that.  It's not all tagged though.  Just warning you.  I put it together quite quick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:184449c74a67135574e88b1c3c75d286dcdc3b55","amp;dn":"Halloween","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"184449c74a67135574e88b1c3c75d286dcdc3b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,68,73,199,74,103,19,85,116,232,139,28,60,117,210,134,220,220,59,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
