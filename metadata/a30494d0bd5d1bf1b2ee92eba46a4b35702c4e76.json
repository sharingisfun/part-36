He is a young man who joins the underworld to seek refuge from unemployment. He has left for Singapore for better job opportunities. From Singapore he regularly sends money home in order to support his family. He loves Abhi immensely and wants to take him to Singapore so that he can get a job there. However because of Abhi not having a passport, he is unable to go. Abhi's brother comes back from Singapore on the day of a bandh and comes to know that Abhi is barred from entering their house by his mother though they do stay in touch. In the meanwhile Abhi meets and falls in love with Nandita (Rituparna Sengupta), a social worker who is his neighbour. The two gangs constantly clash with each other and Kalika Prasad's gang wants to finish off Abhi at any cost. Abhi's sister-in-law is molested by a goon and is saved from graver consequence by Ahmedbhai and his gang. Nandita goes to Abhi and asks him to quit the underworld but Abhis is reluctant and asks Nandita to go back. Meanwhile Abhi's elder brother is able to organize a passport though he has a criminal record. On the day of their departure, Abhi's mother is murdered by Kalika Prasad's son Durga Prasad after she boards an autorickshaw to go to the airport. Abhi's elder brother and other family member desperately try to conceal the truth from Abhi. He is taken to the airport though he senses that something is wrong. He borrows the mobile phone of a fellow passenger and comes to know the truth from his nephew. Abhi returns home and takes revenge by killing Kalika Prasad and his gang with Ahmedbhai. He completes his mother's last rites and leaves for Singapore with his elder brother taking a photograph of their mother along with them.\n\n\nScreenshot:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s22.postimg.org/n69u1tjgh/Akrosh_screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s22.postimg.org/n69u1tjgh/Akrosh_screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a30494d0bd5d1bf1b2ee92eba46a4b35702c4e76","amp;dn":"Aakrosh+%282004%29+Bengali+Movie+WebRip+FLV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a30494d0bd5d1bf1b2ee92eba46a4b35702c4e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,4,148,208,189,93,27,241,178,238,146,235,164,106,75,53,112,44,78,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
