He worked for decades to systematically re-imagine classic Italian dishes without meat. The result, first published in 1930, is a timeless reference work, with dishes that are surprising, inventive, and often decadent. \r\n\r\nEarly chapters like â€œAppetizers and Saladsâ€ include recipes for inventive vegetarian sandwiches and crostini, as well as refreshing salads (and even a recipe for simple homemade ricotta cheese). â€œBroths and Pureesâ€ includes rich and flavorful vegetable broths, hearty purees, and pasta in broth, like vegetarian â€˜Agnollottiâ€™ in broth filled with parmesan and walnuts. \r\n\r\nThe â€œFirst Courses, Pasta Dishes and Timballiâ€ chapter is a comprehensive collection of authentic Italian recipes for gnocchi, risotto, polenta, ravioli, from Risotto â€˜alla Milaneseâ€™ with saffron, nutmeg, and parmesan to Sicilian Style Gnocchi, with fried eggplant and tomato sauce. â€œLuncheon Dishes, Vegetables, Legumes and Side Dishesâ€ features preparations for eggplant and artichokes, and is a great go-to for quick side dishes and lighter vegetarian meals. His main dishes chapters include a variety of casseroles and soufflÃ©s, and the Duke even has several preparations for mock meats, such as vegetarian â€œFoie Gras Mousseâ€ made with ricotta cheese and black truffles. \r\n\r\nMuch more than a recipe book, The Duke's Table is a major re-discovery and a fascinating look into the philosophy of a food revolutionary who was truly before his time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e8ab73edbefc0e8029beb1641b8ae7782796c3","amp;dn":"The+Duke%27s+Table+%282013%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e8ab73edbefc0e8029beb1641b8ae7782796c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,232,171,115,237,190,252,14,128,41,190,177,100,27,138,231,120,39,150,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
