Their love for Sean Connery and dirty jokes inspires these girls to make the moody catchy tunes they do, blending rock, grunge and dark pop into tunes that would romance your mum. An energetic live act, they have already supported bands such as Axe Girl (WA), Hey, Lady! (NSW), Captives (Melb) and Tony Font Show (SA).\r\n\r\nThis is their first EP 'You Only Live Twice' released on Oct 16 2015.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.babesarewolves.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a608223e711198b5301dc3b08dccc5bfec4a67d0","amp;dn":"Babes+Are+Wolves+-+2015+-+You+Only+Live+Twice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a608223e711198b5301dc3b08dccc5bfec4a67d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,8,34,62,113,17,152,181,48,29,195,176,141,204,197,191,236,74,103,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
