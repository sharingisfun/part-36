Protectors of peace and justice, they are called the Green Lantern Corps. A brotherhood of warriors sworn to keep intergalactic order, each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants him superpowers. But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). Hal is a gifted and cocky test pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, who have never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before. -- (C) Warner Bros\n\n\nPG-13, 1 hr. 45 min.\n\nAction &amp; Adventure, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy\n\nDirected By:Martin Campbell\n\nWritten By:Michael Green (VII), Marc Guggenheim, Michael Goldenberg\n\n\nIn Theaters: Jun 17, 2011 Wide\n\nOn DVD: Oct 14, 2011\n\nUS Box Office:$116.6M\n\nWarner Bros.
