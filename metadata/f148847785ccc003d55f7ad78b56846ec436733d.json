Gradually, the members of the squad begin to suspect that some of them are robots.\n\n\nNote: I haven't made this DVDRip, I barely found it myself somewhere else and now I want to share it. It's not a masterpiece of a movie, actually it's a typical 90's B movie but that's the whole point ;) Hard to find. I'll try to seed as much as I can but my upload speed isn't really impressive and I am doing lots of things with my connection, so bear with me. I'll be seeding over night mostly (my time is GMT+1).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f148847785ccc003d55f7ad78b56846ec436733d","amp;dn":"Digital+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f148847785ccc003d55f7ad78b56846ec436733d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,72,132,119,133,204,192,3,213,95,122,215,139,86,132,110,196,54,115,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
