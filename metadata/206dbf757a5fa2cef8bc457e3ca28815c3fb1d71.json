Now, in The Number Sense, Stanislas Dehaene offers a fascinating look at this recent research, in an enlightening exploration of the mathematical mind. Dehaene begins with the eye-opening discovery that animals--including rats, pigeons, raccoons, and chimpanzees--can perform simple mathematical calculations, and that human infants also have a rudimentary number sense. \n\nDehaene suggests that this rudimentary number sense is as basic to the way the brain understands the world as our perception of color or of objects in space, and, like these other abilities, our number sense is wired into the brain. These are but a few of the wealth of fascinating observations contained here. We also discover, for example, that because Chinese names for numbers are so short, Chinese people can remember up to nine or ten digits at a time--English-speaking people can only remember seven. The book also explores the unique abilities of idiot savants and mathematical geniuses, and we meet people whose minute brain lesions render their mathematical ability useless.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206dbf757a5fa2cef8bc457e3ca28815c3fb1d71","amp;dn":"The+Number+Sense%3A+How+the+Mind+Creates+Mathematics+%282011%29+-Mante","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206dbf757a5fa2cef8bc457e3ca28815c3fb1d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,109,191,117,122,95,162,206,248,188,69,126,60,162,136,21,195,251,29,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
