They were famous for wearing &quot;space suit&quot; costumes on stage, and for their innovative electronic guitar sound. They have since released 42 albums, selling more than 18 million records, and still tour.\nThe Spotnicks originated from Bo Starander and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Thelin's duo &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1956), who later became &quot;Rock-Teddy and The Blue Caps&quot;, a group formed in 1957 in Gothenburg now with guitarist Bo Winberg (born 27 March 1939) in the band as well as Bo Starander (born 11 March 1942) (rhythm guitar), and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Thelin (born 27 June 1942) (bass guitar). In 1958 they added Ove Johansson (drums), changed their name to &quot;The Frazers&quot;, and began playing regularly in local clubs. They signed a recording contract in 1961, and changed their name\nto &quot;The Spotnicks&quot;, a play on the Russian satellite Sputnik as suggested by their manager, Roland Ferneborg. Starander was later known as Bob Lander.   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is one of 3 CDs in the 2009 release &quot;3 Original Album Classics&quot;:\nThe Spotnicks (at home) in Gothenburg,\nThe Spotnicks in Tokyo and\nThe Spotnicks in Winterland\n\nThe Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland\noriginal album 1966\nCD produced 1989\n\n01  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Sleigh Ride\n02  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Winter Wonderland\n03  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Here Comes Santa Claus\n04  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Rudolf The Red-Nosed Reindeer\n05  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Frosty The Snowman\n06  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Silent Night\n07  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - White Christmas\n08  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Jingle Bells\n09  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Winterland\n10  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Parade Of Wooden Soldiers\n11  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - I Saw Mama Kissing Santa Claus\n12  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks In Winterland - Auld Lang Syne","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49d75e383bb086ea25edb33799e7945d28eff832","amp;dn":"Spotnicks+-+The+Spotnicks+In+Winterland+%281966%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49d75e383bb086ea25edb33799e7945d28eff832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,215,94,56,59,176,134,234,37,237,179,55,153,231,148,93,40,239,248,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
