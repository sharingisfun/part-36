Auner shows how the multiplicity of musical styles has called into question traditional assumptions about compositional practice, the boundaries of music and noise, and the relationship among composer, performer, and listener. He also shows how composers and their works have played important roles in defining ideas of nation, race, and gender, and thus in shaping the modern world for better and worse.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨\nAbout the author: Joseph Auner is Chair and Professor of Music at Tufts University. His publications include A Schoenberg Reader, The Cambridge Companion to Schoenberg (with Jennifer Shaw), and Postmodern Music/Postmodern Thought (with Judith Lochhead). A past editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Musicological Society, Auner is the recipient of grants from the Getty Center for the Arts and Humanities, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbe29c5d0d20e41d00269290b7eb296f44fc9bea","amp;dn":"Joseph+Auner+-+Music+in+the+20th+%26amp%3B+21st+Centuries+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbe29c5d0d20e41d00269290b7eb296f44fc9bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,226,156,93,13,32,228,29,0,38,146,144,183,235,41,111,68,252,155,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
