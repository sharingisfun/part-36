Led by frontman Nicholas Petricca, who can go from a nervous David Byrne wail to a glassy 90125-era Jon Anderson falsetto in a matter of seconds, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slick blend of classic new wave, tech-savvy dance rock, and mathy indie pop can be jarring upon first listen, but multiple spins reveal an impressively tight unit that understands the thin line between immaculately rendered electro-art pop cacophony and hook-friendly modern rock.
