Some songs were just started and only contain a few notes, and other projects were as good as finished. For your ease, I included both an mp3 and a zipped loop file of every song, which you can open in FL Studio 8. If you find a project of interest to you, don&amp;#039;t hesitate to finish it or remix it or whatever, I would love to hear the result though and some credits would be nice! Hey, I gave you the opportunity to think of the title already, unless you&amp;#039;re into dates...! ;)\n\nSo what genres can you expect:\n\nElectronica\nSoft Rock\nTrance\nTechno\nRnB (rarely)\n\nYou can find rules and contact details in the readme.txt file within the download.\n\nSo what are you waiting for, start remixing! ;)\n\n- Koen (Music Maniak) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicmaniak.2tunes.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicmaniak.2tunes.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cd6fe11190db1024cd83cd6c22f0eff31f4d0b","amp;dn":"Music+Maniak+-+17+Unfinished+FL+Studio+Projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cd6fe11190db1024cd83cd6c22f0eff31f4d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,205,111,225,17,144,219,16,36,205,131,205,108,34,240,239,243,31,77,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
