He is shocked to discover that she has no memory of him nor of her husband and son, Ricky. Investigating with the help of a psychiatrist friend, Oscar discovers that Sandra\\'s state is the result of what she saw that fateful day. Crucially, however, the association between Ricky, the gun and his father\\'s corpse is not quite as straightforward as it initially seemed. But if Ricky did not kill his father, then who did? And why?\n\nYear: 1973\n\nDirector: Sergio Sollima\nCast: Stefania Sandrelli, Sandra Garces, Keir Dullea, Maurice Ronet, Micheline Presle ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc4ac56e1131e16161046db461104dc8c139e68","amp;dn":"1973.Il.diavolo.nel.cervello.it","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc4ac56e1131e16161046db461104dc8c139e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,196,172,86,225,19,30,22,22,16,70,219,70,17,4,220,140,19,158,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
