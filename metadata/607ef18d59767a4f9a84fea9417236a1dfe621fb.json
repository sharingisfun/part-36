Bruce Cabot plays &quot;the Indian&quot;, a womanizing sharpshooter who is gored by a rhino in the opening scenes of the film. This becomes a running theme through the movie; their bad luck in catching rhinos, and provides the climactic ending chase. While Bruce is in the hospital, Elsa Martinelli shows up as a woman photographer from a Swiss zoo, and John wants to send her packing. She strongarms the Duke into letting her stay by promising that her zoo will buy most of their animals this season if she's allowed to go along on the hunts and take photos. Hardy Kruger, Gerard Blain, Michelle Girardon and Valentin de Vargas round out the group. They traipse over the African landscape capturing animals; Elsa also has a running gag where she collects baby elephants as the movie goes along. In the end she's acquired three of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607ef18d59767a4f9a84fea9417236a1dfe621fb","amp;dn":"Hatari.1962.PAL.DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607ef18d59767a4f9a84fea9417236a1dfe621fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,126,241,141,89,118,122,79,154,132,254,169,65,114,54,161,223,230,33,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
