The first full-length project from the celebrated Toronto rapper Jazz Cartier. \n\nWhile many became frustrated while waiting, Jazz masterfully strung his fans along, occasionally dropping an incredible remix or single (Take It Home, Gold &amp; Girls, Etc). With a lot to live up to, the pressure was on while creating Losing Elizabeth. Instead of cracking under the pressure, Jazz created a work of art. 14 tracks, some of them weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already heard, and some are new, all are dope. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll stop talking now and let you listen. Follow Jazz on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\n1. Jazz Cartier - Lost [03:04]\n2. Jazz Cartier - Gold.&amp;.Girls [01:34]\n3.
