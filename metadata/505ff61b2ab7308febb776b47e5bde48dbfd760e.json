Unlike all other guides in the market, this one talks only about hits, not misses; about films that need to be seen and savoured, not about those meant to be dismissed as C-grade tripe. Be rest assured, for the generalist out there, each and every title among the 1,000 films listed in these pages deserves a dekko. Simply because this compendium sifts the chaff from the grain, and reviews only films that have towered at the box office or won critical acclaim. For the specialist, there are 15 categories to choose from, making it easier for the diehard action, sci-fi, crime, horror, romance, classic, Oscar film buff to settle down with her staple fare. No desperate flipping, no endless searching, just choose your genre and follow the star rating system to pick your film. With our carefully calibrated rating system that varies from one to five stars, there is no way you can go wrong. While rating our films, we have taken into account the importance of both mass appeal and artistic excellence: the sensibilities of the frontbencher and the fastidious cineaste. So, you could find a Quentin TÃƒÂ rantino film sharing the same rating with a David Lean classic\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgements 4\nIntroduction 5\n100 Best Classic Films 6\n50 Best Romantic Films 44\n50 Best Guy Films 60\n50 Best Women Films 74\n50 Best Sci-Fi Films 92\n50 Best Action Films 110\n50 Best Crime Films 127\n50 Best Horror Films 144\n50 Best Comedy Films 161\n50 Best Children's Films 179\n50 Best Teen Films 195\n50 Best Adult Films 214\n50 Best Inspirational Films 230\n101 Best Sequels 246\n200 Best Oscar Films 286\nAppendices 361","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:505ff61b2ab7308febb776b47e5bde48dbfd760e","amp;dn":"Times+Movie+Guide+-+Best+of+Hollywood+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"505ff61b2ab7308febb776b47e5bde48dbfd760e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,95,246,27,42,183,48,143,235,183,118,180,126,91,222,72,219,253,118,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
