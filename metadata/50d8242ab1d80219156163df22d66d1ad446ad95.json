The award-winning four-volume Encyclopedia of Sleep is the largest reference, either online or in print, on the subject of sleep. Written to be useful for the novice and the established researcher and clinician, Topic areas will include sleep across the life cycle and in other species, sleep and women, sleep and the elderly, pediatric sleep, sleep deprivation and loss, sleep mechanisms, sleep physiology and pathophysiology, sleep disorders, neurobiology, chronobiology, pharmacology, and impact of other disorders on sleep.\n\nRecognizing the many fields that are connected to sleep science, the editorial team has been carefully chosen to do justice to this highly interdisciplinary field of study. The steady growth of researchers and clinicians in the sleep field attests to the continued interest in the scientific study of sleep and the management of patients with sleep disorders, and anyone involved in this exciting field should find this work to be an invaluable reference.\n\n2013 PROSE Award winner for Multivolume Reference in Science from the Association of American Publishers\nThoroughly interdisciplinary: looks at sleep throughout the life cycle, with exceptional coverage of basic sleep concepts, the physiology of sleep as well as sleep disorders of all descriptions\nExcellent coverage of sleep and special populations, covering the lifespan, as well as gender and ethnic differences, among others\nChapters focusing on sleep disorders are grouped under the broad categories classified in the ICSD-2 for clear organization so that the reader can effectively access the steps involved in diagnosing and treating these disorders\nOnline version is linked both within the encyclopedia (to related content) and to external sources (such as primary journal content) so that users have easy access to more detailed information if needed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d8242ab1d80219156163df22d66d1ad446ad95","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Sleep+-+1st+Ed+%284+Vol+Set%29+%282013%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d8242ab1d80219156163df22d66d1ad446ad95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,216,36,42,177,216,2,25,21,97,99,223,34,214,109,26,212,70,173,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
