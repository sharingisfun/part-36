That's ridiculous. The &quot;reductions&quot; were mere promises to increase future spending less.\n\n[...]\n\nIn my syndicated column today, I write about what I WISH Obama had said.\n\nI have this dream - one where my president walks to the podium, and he instead says this:\n\nI'm so happy I won again. Now that I don't have to suck up to my base, I will be the grown-up in the room...\n\nI looked at the numbers, and they are scary. I made so many promises that there's no way we can pay for them.\n\nTake climate change. I think it's real and that man contributes, but even if America spent trillions to try to lower our carbon output, that would only make a microscopic change in world temperatures. The earth wouldn't notice.\n\nSome of my anti-poverty plans are worse. Now that I've been re-elected, it dawns on me that those programs I said need more investment - always more - well, they didn't work. They perpetuate poverty by making Americans dependent.\n\nThe key to helping the poor - and being rich enough to adjust to things like climate change - is growth.\n\nAmerica grew fastest when government was tiny...\n\nThe rest of my dream speech here. You can watch a version of it on my show on Fox Business at 9pm ET this Thursday.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f45c925f263d31d832e0af50a6b406d93eb38e","amp;dn":"20130214-Stossel-%5BState+of+the+Union%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f45c925f263d31d832e0af50a6b406d93eb38e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,244,92,146,95,38,61,49,216,50,224,175,80,166,180,6,217,62,179,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
