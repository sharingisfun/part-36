This dynamic original series dramatizes the final hour leading up to several pivotal historical events. Here we experience history just before it became history.Using a real-time clock and a split-screen to follow key players, the series reveals the chilling lead-up to events that changed the world including the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.\n\n\n\nEpisode 3 : Terror in Tokyo \n\nOn Monday 20th March 1995 during morning rush hour, a terrorist organisation attacked five crowded commuter trains in the heart of Tokyo with nerve gas. Using a real-time split-screen format, this programme reveals, minute by-minute, the horrific effects that nerve gas has on people who are completely unaware of what is happening to them. It explains how their central nervous systems were paralysed by this terrifying man-made agent and how they suffocated where they stood. This anonymous, indiscriminate and seemingly motiveless attempt at mass murder shocked the world.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b64a01285a82f22557c74ab6afde12a11238fb","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.03of10.Terror.in.Tokyo.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b64a01285a82f22557c74ab6afde12a11238fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,182,74,1,40,90,130,242,37,87,199,74,182,175,222,18,161,18,56,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
