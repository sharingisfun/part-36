Following on from their lauded live set at last yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ultra festival in Miami, the newly rejuvenated production duo released their eagerly anticipated second long player Pylon Pigs through Platipus Records.\n\nUnion Jack originally began as a collaboration between PlatipusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legendary label boss Simon Berry and Claudio Giussani. Disillusioned at the state of the early 90s music industry they joined forces, firstly remixing NicelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Away The Throttle Pedal Stop, before releasing their seminal debut single Two Full Moons and A Trout, an instant hit and sure-fire dancefloor destroyer it entered the pantheon of all time greats and is rightly regarded as a classic across the globe. Follow up single Cactus, reinforced their burgeoning reputation before their debut album There Will Be No Armageddon crowned them as kings of British Trance, demonstrating their effortless abilities to make silver-toned sounds for both home and dance floor listening as their third single Red Herring continued their clubland assault.\n\nFast forward to 2008, after a 7-year hiatus, Union Jack this time featuring Simon Berry and new production partner Paul Brogden (POB/Seismic Records) recommenced, blowing apart the Ultra Festival with a career spanning live set taking in all their classic cuts. Following the success of that live date the pair entered the studio to work on Pylon Pigs Union JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first brand-new material in 11 years.\n\nKicking of their latest set, recent album precursor Papillon wastes no time dropping some bass propelled arpeggio goodness as Simon and Paul lay down the grooves for Union JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s depth and power to take centre stage. Submerge drips with string driven melodic beauty enveloping you in its liquid riffs before Triclops growling bottom end and hypnotic chops draw you in deeper still. LonghornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pounding heart is peppered with off kilter riffs as the rail-track rhythms of Mainlining take over, guiding you on an aural expedition that dovetails with the off beat pads of Blink sucking you into its snaking harmonies that build and build. LifebloodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comb-filtered vocal samples and sinister synths provide a gentle interlude before VowelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minimal bass and percussion develop into an expansive excursion taking you into Pylon PigsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ home straight. The Dark MajorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jazzy lilting pulse is interspersed with warped glitch before FunnelwebÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epic rolling riffs complete a stunning return for Union Jack.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.
