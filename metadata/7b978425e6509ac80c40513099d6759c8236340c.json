Later in the year it was released across Europe to universal acclaim and huge commercial success. Her second album The Shocking Miss Emerald, released in the spring of 2013, was a No.1 album in the UK and Holland and continues to be a top chart title in many territories. This performance was filmed at the BBC Radio Theatre for BBC's In Concert series earlier this year, with a 60 minute version being broadcast on BBC Radio 2 and on digital TV. The show features a mix of tracks from both her studio albums, including all her hits, and with a cover version of the Noel Coward song Mad About The Boy. Caro Emerald is a wonderful live performer with a fantastic voice and an engaging personality and this concert captures her at her best.\n\nYear: 2013\nQuality: BD Remux\nFormat: MKV\nVideo: AVC, &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5f173638371f136b716e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;, 16:9 (1920x1080i), 29994 kbps, 29,970 fps\nAudio 1: LPCM, 2 ch, 1536 kbps, 16-bit, 48 kHz\nAudio 2: DTS MA / Core, 6 ch, 2874 kbps/1509 kbps, 16-bit, 48 kHz\nChapters: Yes\nDuration: 1:30:01\n\nMembers: \nCaro Emerald (Lead Vocals; with the Grandmono Orchestra), \nPeter Bergman (Bass), \nStefan Kruger (Drums), \nWieger Hoogendorp (Guitar), \nStefan Schmid (Keyboards); \nGuido Nijs (Saxophone); \nLouk Boudesteijn (Trombone); \nRobbert Scherpenisse (Trumpet), \nDJ Git Hyper (Turntables)\n\nTracklist:\n01.
