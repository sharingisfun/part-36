She was screaming. Drenched in blood. Then she vanished.\n\nA year later, Annaliese is found wandering down a road hundreds of miles away. She doesn't know who she is. She doesn't know how she got there. She only knows one thing: She is not the real Annaliese Rose Gordon.\n\nNow Annaliese is haunted by strange visions and broken memories. Memories of a reckless, desperate wish . . . a bloody razor . . . and the faces of other girls who disappeared. Piece by piece, Annaliese's fractured memories come together to reveal a violent, endless cycle that she will never escape - unless she can unlock the twisted secrets of her past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dec3593fb07cd998963236166249babe9bad276","amp;dn":"Another+Little+Piece+-+Kate+Karyus+Quinn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dec3593fb07cd998963236166249babe9bad276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,236,53,147,251,7,205,153,137,99,35,97,102,36,155,171,233,186,210,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
