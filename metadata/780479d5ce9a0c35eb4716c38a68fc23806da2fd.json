He was highly respected by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven; the latter two preferred him as conductor of their new works (e.g., Beethoven's First Symphony, in 1800). Wranitzky was a prolific composer. His output comprises ten operas, 44 symphonies, at least 56 string quartets (some sources give a number as high as 73) and a large amount of other orchestral and chamber music. His opera, Oberon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Fairy King from 1789 was a favorite in this genre and inspired Emanuel Schikaneder to write the libretto of The Magic Flute for Mozart in 1791; in the mid-1790s, Goethe sought to collaborate with Wranitzky on a sequel to the Mozart opera.\n\nHe was a pupil of Mozart, Haydn and Albrechtsberger, as mentioned in a letter from Pavel VranickÃƒÂ½ to the music publisher AndrÃƒÂ©.\n\n\n\nPaul Wranitzky - Symphonies, Op. 31, 52\n\nAntonin Vranicky - Symphonie Aphrodite - 1 - Adagio - Allegro con fuoco\nAntonin Vranicky - Symphonie Aphrodite - 2 - Andante - Allegro\nAntonin Vranicky - Symphonie Aphrodite - 3 - Adagio - Allegro vivace\n\nAntonin Vranicky - Violin Concerto 1 to 3\n\nTomasek - Vranicky - Missae","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780479d5ce9a0c35eb4716c38a68fc23806da2fd","amp;dn":"Wranitzky+Classical+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780479d5ce9a0c35eb4716c38a68fc23806da2fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,4,121,213,206,154,12,53,235,71,22,195,138,104,252,35,128,109,162,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
