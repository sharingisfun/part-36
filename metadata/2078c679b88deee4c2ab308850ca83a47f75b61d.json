Mysterious Traveller is the most successful album of this period, but excellent improvisations like &quot;Cucumber Slumber&quot; and &quot;Blackthorn Rose&quot; notwithstanding, there is energy missing in all of these works due to the contained percussion work and the overall technological veneer of the music.&quot; *****\n- Bob Blumenthal, Rolling Stone\n\n&quot;Not bad, not bad--but is that all there is? Maybe what makes the traveller so mysterious is that he doesn't go anywhere in particular. Not even with Alphonso Johnson pushing like hell from underneath.&quot; B\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2078c679b88deee4c2ab308850ca83a47f75b61d","amp;dn":"Weather+Report+-+Mysterious+Traveller+%281974+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2078c679b88deee4c2ab308850ca83a47f75b61d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,120,198,121,184,141,238,228,194,171,48,136,80,202,131,164,127,117,182,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
