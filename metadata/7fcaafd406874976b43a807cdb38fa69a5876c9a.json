When a new home can be found for them, they are lovingly and painstakingly rebuilt. These are not grand buildings, but everyday buildings that give an extraordinary insight into the lives of the people who lived and worked in them. Deep within their fabric are preserved astonishing stories about how we lived and worked.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThis episode follows the construction of a fully working coal-fired Edwardian fish and chip shop at Beamish Museum. Charlie helps with the refurbishment of one of the world's oldest surviving frying ranges, and gets a horse-drawn fish and chip cart back on the road. Meanwhile, Dan discovers the surprising origins of our national dish and explores its rise from squalid back-street outlets to grand fish and chip palaces\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1545 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beamish.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beamish.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fcaafd406874976b43a807cdb38fa69a5876c9a","amp;dn":"BBC+Brick+by+Brick+Rebuilding+Our+Past+2of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fcaafd406874976b43a807cdb38fa69a5876c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,202,175,212,6,135,73,118,180,58,128,124,219,56,250,105,165,135,108,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
