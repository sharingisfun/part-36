His career included a swing-era spring and a long Indian summer, but this great date was recorded between those periods, in 1960. It was Cannonball Adderley's idea to team Johnson with four brass; brother Nat's cornet is joined by the trumpets of Harry Edison, Ray Nance (doubling on violin) and Clark Terry (doubling on flugelhorn). The soloing is inspired, the program is well chosen and Johnson's arrangements are great. This is modern-mainstream jazz at its best. (JazzTimes)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - All My Love\n02 - Blue Lou\n03 - Trinity River Bottom\n04 - Driftwood\n05 - Blues For Lester\n06 - The Message\n07 - Dont't Blame Me\n08 - I'll Get By (As Long As I Have You)\n\nEnjoy and share!
