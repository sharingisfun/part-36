The author takes us behind the scenes during the filming of the western classicsâ€” Virginian (1914), Cimarron (1931), Stagecoach (1939), She Wore A Yellow Ribbon (1949), High Noon (1952) â€” where we meet the movie cowboys: &quot;Broncho Billy&quot; Anderson who couldn't ride a horse, William S. Hart, Tom Mix, the champion rodeo star who wore diamond- studded belts, Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and many, many others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eec721ccc29fc71212883c2c114b97b25ea7027","amp;dn":"Cameras+West+%28Art+Movie+Film%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eec721ccc29fc71212883c2c114b97b25ea7027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,236,114,28,204,41,252,113,33,40,131,194,193,20,185,123,37,234,112,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
