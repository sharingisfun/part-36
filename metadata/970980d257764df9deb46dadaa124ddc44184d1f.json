The songs didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit with the tracks Josh Ritter was writing for his still-untitled forthcoming album. As he described it, the tracks were ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstrays,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not all they had in common. Every track on album contains the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdarlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at some point. In bringing the collection of songs together, Ritter had his title for the EP: Bringing in the Darlings. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt always kind of rolls off the tongue,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ritter told Paste about the reoccurring word. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt certainly fits in the songs, I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a plaintive word. I imagine, what would a cowboy say to a longhorn?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ To Ritter, the songs felt immediate and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmall,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ so he wanted to make sure those qualities transferred to the recording process.\n\nRitter, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s known for sonically impressive records like The Animal Years and So Runs the World Away, decided to take a more direct route to record the songs that appear on Bringing in the Darlings. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs time goes on, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good to remember that recording is not necessarily a long process,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ritter said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always a fun process, and what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re trying to do is balance the art form of the recording with the excitement of recording it. I think thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a certain spark when somethingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s written and it rolls off the tongue easily, and you can always hear the personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excitement when itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s happening.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s six songs were recorded in three days in a small studio in Brooklyn called Homeward Sound. As they were recorded, Ritter didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really have plans for the tracks, but the idea of a small, surprise release became more and more appealing. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuddenly the songs were here,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ritter said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI thought it would be a really fun project to do something that was secret and was just pick up and go.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nThe songs that appear on Bringing in the Darlings are exclusive to the EP and wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t appear on RitterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forthcoming album.\n\nX Lossless Decoder used to rip the EP\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/22/josh-ritter/[/url]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970980d257764df9deb46dadaa124ddc44184d1f","amp;dn":"Josh+Ritter...Bringing+In+The+Darlings%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970980d257764df9deb46dadaa124ddc44184d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,9,128,210,87,118,77,249,222,180,109,173,170,18,77,220,68,24,77,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
