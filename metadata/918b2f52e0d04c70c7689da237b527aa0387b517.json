Meanwhile, an aspiring singer (Morgan) and his songwriter girlfriend (Leslie) conspire to get into the charity program by replacing Cantor with their look-alike friend, tour bus driver Joe Simpson (also played by Cantor, in a dual role).\n\nMany of Warner Brothers's stars performed in musical numbers, including several who were not known as singers. The film features the only screen musical numbers ever done by Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ida Lupino. Each of the cast members was paid a $50,000 fee for their appearance which was then donated to the Hollywood Canteen.\n\nThe film was popular with audiences, and the critic James Agee called it &quot;the loudest and most vulgar of the current musicals. It is also the most fun.&quot; Ticket sales combined with the donated salaries of the performers raised more than two million dollars for the Hollywood Canteen.\n\n     MUSICAL NUMBERS:-\n    &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; sung by Dinah Shore\n    &quot;Ridin' For a Fall&quot; sung by Dennis Morgan and Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland)\n    &quot;Hotcha Cornia&quot; performed by Spike Jones &amp; His City Slickers\n    &quot;We're Staying Home Tonight&quot; sung by Eddie Cantor\n    &quot;Goin' North&quot; sung by Jack Carson and Alan Hale, Sr.\n    &quot;Love Isn't Born (It's Made)&quot; sung by Ann Sheridan\n    &quot;No You, No Me&quot; sung by Dennis Morgan and Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland)\n    &quot;The Dreamer&quot; sung by Dinah Shore\n    &quot;Ice Cold Katie&quot; performed by Hattie McDaniel and Willie Best\n    &quot;How Sweet You Are&quot; sung by Dinah Shore\n    &quot;That's What You Jolly Well Get&quot; sung by Errol Flynn\n    &quot;They're Either Too Young, Or Too Old&quot; sung by Bette Davis, including a brief jitterbug performance by Davis and dancecontest winner Conrad Weidel.
