It emerges following the conducting line of the non-volatile memory in the wireless system: On the one hand it develops the foundations of the interdisciplinary issues needed for design analysis and testing of the system. On the other hand it deals with many of the problems appearing when the systems are realized in industrial production. These cover the difficulties from the mobile system to the different types of non-volatile memories.\n\nThe book explores memory cards, multichip technologies, and algorithms of the software management as well as error handling. It also presents techniques of assurance for the single components and a guide through the Datasheet lectures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371b8906d98c186ecbdfabd8c85e85bc54263e2d","amp;dn":"Memories+in+Wireless+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371b8906d98c186ecbdfabd8c85e85bc54263e2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,27,137,6,217,140,24,110,203,223,171,216,200,94,133,188,84,38,62,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
