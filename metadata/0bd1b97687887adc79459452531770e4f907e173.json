Once a member of the all-female Waking the Witch, she released a remarkable solo album two years ago that was full of thoughtful, emotional songs about love. She returns to the theme here with a new set that shows her gift for strong melodies, and ranges from the pained but passionate No Contract to the bleak and witty Not the One, and a bravely intense study of love and longing, Seven Buttons. For contrast, there's a troubled and spooky story about hacking, From Your Computer. Her last album was very much a DIY affair, but this time round her easygoing vocals and guitar work are helped out by backing from distinguished admirers, with the duo of Belinda O'Hooley and Heidi Tidow adding accordion, keyboards and backing vocals, and Anna Esslemont from Uiscedwr playing fiddle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd1b97687887adc79459452531770e4f907e173","amp;dn":"Patsy+Matheson+-+Domino+Girls+%5B2014%5D%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd1b97687887adc79459452531770e4f907e173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,209,185,118,135,136,122,220,121,69,148,82,83,23,112,228,249,7,225,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
