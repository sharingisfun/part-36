In The Information Master, Jacob Soll shows how the legacy of Colbert's encyclopedic tradition lies at the very center of the rise of the modern state and was a precursor to industrial intelligence and Internet search engines.\nSoll's innovative look at Colbert's rise to power argues that his practice of collecting knowledge originated from techniques of church scholarship and from Renaissance Italy, where merchants recognized the power to be gained from merging scholarship, finance, and library science. With his connection of interdisciplinary approaches---regarding accounting, state administration, archives, libraries, merchant techniques, ecclesiastical culture, policing, and humanist pedagogy---Soll has written an innovative book that will redefine not only the history of the reign of Louis XIV and information science but also the study of political and economic history.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Information-Master-Jean-Baptiste-Intelligence/dp/0472034642/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373366193&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Information+Master%3A+Jean-Baptiste+Colbert%27s+Secret+State+Intelligence+System&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Information-Master-Jean-Baptiste-Intelligence/dp/0472034642/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373366193&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Information+Master%3A+Jean-Baptiste+Colbert%27s+Secret+State+Intelligence+System&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b03da4d7fb6d0a117959c35605e811c4019ffef","amp;dn":"The+Information+Master%3A+Jean-Baptiste+Colberts+Secret+State+Inte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b03da4d7fb6d0a117959c35605e811c4019ffef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,3,218,77,127,182,208,161,23,149,156,53,96,94,129,28,64,25,255,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
