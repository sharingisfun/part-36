I am totally grateful for your services. I live in Ghana, West Africa, and so have very slow internet connection. It really makes a big difference in download time when the files are as compressed as yours. \nI was wondering if by any chance you were considering putting up the Academy Awards telecast tomorrow?? I would be even more grateful than I already am if you did!!\nKeep up the good work!! \n\n&gt;twentyforty at 2010-03-07 06:34 CET: \n\n@closetmaniac: Yes, because every year ceremony was released as 1.34 GB XviD (it automatically &quot;fits&quot; in by &quot;really big in size&quot;). Just be here around Monday noon. \n\n2nd part (last hour of the show) would be posted separately, after this one. Apologies, restrictions are because of the size.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e10edf8c292a41c31fc5773db47629b5796e5d","amp;dn":"Oscars.Main.Event.2010.Part1.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e10edf8c292a41c31fc5773db47629b5796e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,225,14,223,140,41,42,65,195,31,197,119,61,180,118,41,181,121,110,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
