Originally a small    |  \n|       operation, we have now reached levels of international acclaim.       |  \n|                                                                             |  \n|  SOUR is dedicated to both the availability and promotion of music to the   |  \n|  public, and our rips are intended to reflect these ideals.

SOUR is dedicated to the promotion of new music that is currently         |  \n|   available to buy. If you like something you hear, you are obliged to      |  \n|   attempt to purchase an original copy.                                     |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the promotion of old music that may no longer be     |  \n|   available to buy.                                                         |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the expansion and infiltration of drum&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;bass        |  \n|   worldwide! We provide a service where none is available, specifically in  |  \n|   many remote countries where traditional distributors can not afford to    |  \n|   target. Also, the availability of drum&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;bass in an easily accessible     |  \n|   form expands the potential for real world sales to people who may not     |  \n|   otherwise have considered buying drum&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;bass.                             |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| . SOUR is dedicated to the expansion of the online and offline real world   |  \n|   scenes. With more listeners enjoying what they hear, clubs and venues can |  \n|   only expect MORE people to attend events; DJ&amp;#039;s can only expect MORE       |  \n|   people to pay to see THEM.                                                |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| By accident of today&amp;#039;s current real world distribution arrangements, many   |  \n|   artists will find that SOUR releases IMPROVE their real world sales;      |  \n|  especially for items only on vinyl.
