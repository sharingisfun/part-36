Having just turned 16, the three teens with a common affinity for &quot;oldies&quot; music and harmony spent the better part of the next 2 years playing shows around the Delaware/Pennsylvania area. Influenced as much by their parent's record collections as they were by what they heard on the radio, their style began to take shape into something a little bit both and a little bit neither. When high school graduation came along, their paths divided; years passed and things changed, but before they knew it they were all living within a few blocks of each other in New York City. The transition back into making music together was as natural as it was surprising - they happily picked up where they had left off years before, with a unique style that refuses to sit comfortably in any genre.\n\n\n\n\n\nCleare, Robb, and Smith are all songwriters and multi-instrumentalists. They use their strengths as a trio to create a sound that listeners might expect from a band twice their size. With an emphasis on 3-part harmony and a variety of instrumental switching, their range and energy onstage make each live show a unique event.\n\nBefore they were The Spring Standards, all three members were in Old Springs Pike along with John Gallagher Jr..\n\n\nThe band members are:\n\n* James Cleare - vocals, acoustic and bass guitars, and drums\n* Heather Robb - vocals, melodica, keyboard, glockenspiel and drums\n* James Smith - acoustic and bass guitars, vocals, harmonica and drums\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Skyline\n02 - Here I Am\n03 - Queen of the Lot\n04 - Halcyon Days\n05 - Bells and Whistles\n06 - Not Again\n07 - Frozen\n08 - Trouble\n09 - Sharks\n10 - The Hush\n11 - Unravel Unwind\n12 - Drowning In Sobriety (Bonus Track Version)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spring_Standards&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spring_Standards&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thespringstandards.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thespringstandards.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; AS ALWAYS: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b977165acd0f11b075c1bd65dbfd491c7a6d8d","amp;dn":"The+Spring+Standards+-+Would+Things+be+Different+%282010%29%28Indie+Fo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b977165acd0f11b075c1bd65dbfd491c7a6d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,185,119,22,90,205,15,17,176,117,193,189,101,219,253,73,28,122,109,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
