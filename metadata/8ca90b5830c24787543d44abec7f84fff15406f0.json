Initially trained as a sculptor, Anderson did her first performance-art piece in the late 1960s. Throughout the 1970s, Anderson did a variety of different performance-art activities. She became widely known outside the art world in 1981 when her single &quot;O Superman&quot; reached number two on the UK pop charts. She also starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave.\n\nAnderson is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she developed a talking stick, a six-foot-long baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds.\n\nAnderson started dating Lou Reed in 1992, and was married to the singer-songwriter and guitarist from 2008 until his death on October 27, 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ca90b5830c24787543d44abec7f84fff15406f0","amp;dn":"Laurie+Anderson+-FLAC+Studio+Dicography%2B2+Live+cd%27s%2B1+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ca90b5830c24787543d44abec7f84fff15406f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,169,11,88,48,194,71,135,84,61,68,171,236,127,132,255,241,84,6,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
