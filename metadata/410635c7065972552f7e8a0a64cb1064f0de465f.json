The results were magic. Ever since Jazz Samba, the jazz marketplace had been flooded with bossa nova albums, and the overexposure was beginning to make the music seem like a fad. Getz/Gilberto made bossa nova a permanent part of the jazz landscape not just with its unassailable beauty, but with one of the biggest smash hit singles in jazz history Ã¢â‚¬â€ &quot;The Girl From Ipanema,&quot; a Jobim classic sung by Jo&amp;atilde;o's wife, Astrud Gilberto, who had never performed outside of her own home prior to the recording session. Beyond that, most of the Jobim songs recorded here also became standards of the genre Ã¢â‚¬â€ &quot;Corcovado&quot; (which featured another vocal by Astrud), &quot;So Dan&amp;ccedil;o Samba,&quot; &quot;O Grande Amor,&quot; a new version of &quot;Desafinado.&quot; With such uniformly brilliant material, it's no wonder the album was such a success but, even apart from that, the musicians all play with an effortless grace that's arguably the fullest expression of bossa nova's dreamy romanticism ever brought to American listeners. Getz himself has never been more lyrical, and Gilberto and Jobim pull off the harmonic and rhythmic sophistication of the songs with a warm, relaxed charm. This music has nearly universal appeal; it's one of those rare jazz records about which the purist elite and the buying public are in total agreement. Beyond essential. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:410635c7065972552f7e8a0a64cb1064f0de465f","amp;dn":"GetzGilberto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"410635c7065972552f7e8a0a64cb1064f0de465f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,6,53,199,6,89,114,85,47,126,138,10,100,203,16,100,240,222,70,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
