Although the first years of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s treated him exceptionally well -- many classic sessions arrived in the first few years of the decade, many showcased on 1962Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s peerless Ã¢â‚¬Å“rocking chairÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album -- this is where his legacy lies: with the spooky, primal howl that kicks off Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoaninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at MidnightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the scores of earthy boogies and down-and-dirty grinds that followed. Smokestack Lightning stacks up plenty of alternate takes, a good chunk of them never released in the U.S., but the repetition doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t slow the set down or turn it repetitive. Instead, the repeated alternate takes sit well with the treasures -- many justly celebrated, some unearthed -- all adding up to a testament to Howlin' WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unearthly, mighty force. --Stephen Thomas Erlewine, AllMusicGuide\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hip-oselect.com/scr.public.product.asp?product_id=A3040FFB-AC36-4044-BE68-D69DAB6643F6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hip-oselect.com/scr.public.product.asp?product_id=A3040FFB-AC36-4044-BE68-D69DAB6643F6&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe7411984681ac89a47f96ca7049df0dac9fb885","amp;dn":"Howlin%27+Wolf+-+Smokestack+Lightning+The+Complete+Chess+Masters+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe7411984681ac89a47f96ca7049df0dac9fb885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,116,17,152,70,129,172,137,164,127,150,202,112,73,223,13,172,159,184,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
