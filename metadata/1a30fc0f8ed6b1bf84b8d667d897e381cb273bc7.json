But the only thing to download in torrent was the main fight only in good quality, and the always horrible and purposely flawed Sir Paul release. But as quality is not something that the usual uploaders look after, nor the ones that download, as you see them saying &quot;thanks V=10 A=10&quot; no matter how shitty the quality is, no one bother to upload something proper. \n\n\n  What's the problem with Sir Paul releases? Well usually what he does is to take a 50/25fps (PAL) source and transcode it to 29.97fps...The result could be not so bad but he manage to do so. The video looks horribly skipped and even highly soft (that's an extra) like an upscaled 480p. If you go frame by frame in his 720p releases with this issue, you'll see it's 2 frames with a range of movement and a third with less range of movement. Also there's an pixel instability, mudding and blocking. But you can compare: this Koenig release is from the same source as his, and the quality is much much higher, sharper, steady, no artifacts or aberrations, anything. Look at the BTSport logo  bottom right in both releases. There's no doubt that Sir Paul is doing it wrong.\n\n   I've read many times some fools complaining that the 25fps &quot;looks like a slideshow&quot;, and ask that the uploader to do so in 29,97, and while I agree that the PAL 25 fps is too slow for some sports, you just cannot convert it, as the results of &quot;reframe&quot; it are even worse. I think Sir Paul started doing this because of those comments, just silly. \n\n  Sir Paul is not the only one that do this things though, and in a recent event someone even grab a 29.97 and put it in a 60fps container and said that it was actually 60fps (even without any interpolation), it was just 2 cloned frames all the time. But this at least looked like a 29,97 (which it was), on the other hand, Sir Paul doing what he does looks even &quot;skippier&quot; than the original 25fps: it looks almost like a 15fps video. \n\n  What Sir Paul should do is leave the original 25fps or better if his source is 50fps, try to come with an encoding method to keep the 50fps without increasing the size too much.\n\n  So, Sir Paul, thank you for your uploads, but you are doing it wrong (like I do with english), when you can do it just fine.\n\n  Now, understand that all this critic is aimed at improving the uploads, at having better releases's quality.\n\n  Oh and another thing, to the others uploaders, is not so fucking hard to paste the specifications of the uploads as I just did above, Drarbg, TvTeam, etc, that was for you. Its easy: in PotPlayer for example is &quot;Ctrl+F1&quot; --&gt; &quot;File Information&quot;--&gt; &quot;Copy to clipboard&quot;, and delete your locations, that's it, it just takes 10 seconds...\n\n  And don't be mentally weak: don't take offense by critics.\n\n  Sorry for my hideous english.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a30fc0f8ed6b1bf84b8d667d897e381cb273bc7","amp;dn":"UFC.Fight.Night.39.Shogun.vs.Henderson.2.720p.HDTV.x264-KOENiG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a30fc0f8ed6b1bf84b8d667d897e381cb273bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,48,252,15,142,214,177,191,132,184,214,103,216,151,227,129,203,39,59,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
