Not only did his girlfriend break his heart at work - and in front of all of the video - store patronsbut he just got fired. On the way home, Matt decides to quiet his aching heart with a brief detour to a garage sale. When an ancient-looking helmet calls to him as &quot;the Chosen One&quot; exhorting him to don the mantle of the &quot;Valhalladrim&quot; Matt touches it with trembling fingers-and is jolted by raw magical power. Holy crap! Is he going to be a superhero? Is this why he always felt special even when everyone else thought he was a loser? Then the helm gets a sense of whom it's dealing with.
