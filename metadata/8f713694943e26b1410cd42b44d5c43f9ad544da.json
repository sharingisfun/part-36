A young lawyer (Jonathan Harker) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe. He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray. In Britain, Dracula begins a reign of seduction and terror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy's friends gather together to try to drive Dracula away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f713694943e26b1410cd42b44d5c43f9ad544da","amp;dn":"Bram+Stoker%5C%27s+Dracula+Full+DVD+Iso.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f713694943e26b1410cd42b44d5c43f9ad544da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,113,54,148,148,62,38,177,65,12,212,43,68,213,196,63,154,213,68,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
