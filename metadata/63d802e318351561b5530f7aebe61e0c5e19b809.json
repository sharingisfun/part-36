Starring Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary, and Nina Foch, the film is set in Paris, and was directed by Vincente Minnelli from a script by Alan Jay Lerner. The music is by George Gershwin, with lyrics by his brother Ira, with additional music by Saul Chaplin, the music director.\n\nThe story of the film is interspersed with dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and set to Gershwin's music. Songs and music include &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, &quot;I'll Build A Stairway to Paradise&quot;, &quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â°'S Wonderful&quot;, and &quot;Our Love is Here to Stay&quot;. The climax of the film is &quot;The American in Paris&quot; ballet, a 16 minute dance featuring Kelly and Caron set to Gershwin's An American in Paris. The ballet alone cost more than $500,000.\n\nPlot\n\nJerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly), an American World War II veteran, is now an exuberant expatriate in Paris trying to make a reputation as a painter. His friend, Adam (Oscar Levant), is a struggling concert pianist who is a long time associate of a French singer, Henri Baurel (Georges GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tary). A lonely society woman, Milo Roberts (Nina Foch), takes Jerry under her wing and supports him, but is more interested in Jerry than his art. Jerry remains oblivious to her feelings and falls in love with Lise (Leslie Caron), a French girl he meets at a restaurant. Lise loves him as well but she is already in a relationship with Henri, to whom she feels indebted for keeping her safe during World War II. For most of the film Jerry is unaware of Lise's relationship with Henri.\n\nEventually Jerry learns that Lise is in love with him but is marrying Henri the next day. He invites Milo to a masked ball that night. At the raucous masked ball, with everyone in black-and-white costumes, Milo learns from Adam that Jerry is not interested in her, and Henri overhears Jerry and Lise saying goodbye to each other. When Henri and Lise drive away, Jerry daydreams about being with her all over Paris to the tune of the George Gershwin composition An American in Paris. His reverie is broken by a car horn, the sound of Henri bringing Lise back to him. They embrace as the Gershwin composition (and the film) ends.\n\nCast\n\nGene Kelly as Jerry Mulligan\nLeslie Caron as Lise Bouvier\nOscar Levant as Adam Cook\nGeorges GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tary as Henri &quot;Hank&quot; Baurel\nNina Foch as Milo Roberts\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nWins\n\nAcademy Award for Best Picture: Arthur Freed, producer\nAcademy Award for Best Art ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Set Decoration, Color: E.
