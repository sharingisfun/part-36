My Norton say it has one and it tried to block the false + upon downloading the file, then my Norton quarantined the file and had to restore the file again. \n\nI had no further problems and the activation for my &quot;Windows 7 Ultimate&quot; was fully successful with no viral issues. \n\nI just ran the basic interface and let it do the work for me. You will see it count down once you execute &quot;w7lxe.exe&quot;. Just let it count down and do nothing. Hope it works for you!
