From their iconic and wildly named Dirt Style battle break records (Black Market Snuff Breaks, 100mph Backsliding Turkey Kuts anyone?) to their oft-bootlegged live battle routines, the two have left an indelible mark on global DJ culture. With D-Styles a regular now at LAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous Low End Theory nights and Qbert pursuing turntable education, DJ-centric product design, animated movies and video game scoring, the two continue to expand the world of DJ-ing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685eec331080fa477b44166cfc9c068b4558fd6a","amp;dn":"D-Styles_Q-Bert_Live_at_Voodoo_2012_New_Orleans_MIN_.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685eec331080fa477b44166cfc9c068b4558fd6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,94,236,51,16,128,250,71,123,68,22,108,252,156,6,139,69,88,253,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
