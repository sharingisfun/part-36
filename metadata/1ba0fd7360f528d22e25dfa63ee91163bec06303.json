Manufactured independently by Ramble Krohn himself in anticipation of his upcoming tour dates throughout the US this fall, only a few thousand copies of &amp;quot;In Rare Form&amp;quot; will be circulated worldwide, a mere fraction of the fans who picked up his two smash albums &amp;quot;Dead Ringer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Since We Last Spoke&amp;quot;. So be sure to cop your CD or double vinyl ASAP, before they're all gone! Includes 13 hard to find instrumental tracks (+ 5 bonus beats on CD) from some of RJ's best known collabos with MF Doom/Viktor Vaughn, Diverse, Soul Position, Copywrite, Cage, Tame-One and others...many of which have never been available to the public before in ANY format!..&quot;\n\nenjoy&amp;share\npeace\nheiLand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba0fd7360f528d22e25dfa63ee91163bec06303","amp;dn":"rjd2-in_rare_form_%28unreleased_instrumentals%29-2004-cms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba0fd7360f528d22e25dfa63ee91163bec06303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,160,253,115,96,245,40,210,46,37,223,166,62,233,17,99,190,192,99,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
