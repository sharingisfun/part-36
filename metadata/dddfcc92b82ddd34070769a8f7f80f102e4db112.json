One is an L.A. singer, formerly of the Platters; one is a petty thief from Philly; one teaches school in a small Georgia town. Each claims to be the widow of long-dead doo-wop singer-songwriter Frankie Lyman, and each wants years of royalties due to his estate, money Levy has never shared. During an ensuing civil trial, flashbacks tell the story of each one's life with Lyman, a boyish, high-pitched, dynamic performer, lost to heroin. Slowly, the three wives establish their own bond.\n\nNotes:\nThis is the true story about Frankie Lymon and his relation life.\nIt's very hard to find I have been looking all over the internet for it and only found it on youtube. Enjoy it's a great movie for rock'n'roll enthusiasts!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dddfcc92b82ddd34070769a8f7f80f102e4db112","amp;dn":"Why+Do+Fools+Fall+In+Love+-+Lidis+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dddfcc92b82ddd34070769a8f7f80f102e4db112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,223,204,146,184,45,221,52,7,7,105,168,247,248,15,16,46,77,177,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
