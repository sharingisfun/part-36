Having been the only Hollywood film maker to continue to \nmake silent films well into the period of sound films, this was Chaplin's first \ntrue talking picture as well as his most commercially successful film.[1] More \nimportantly, it was the first major feature film of its period to bitterly \nsatirize Nazism and Adolf Hitler.\nAt the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace \nwith Nazi Germany. Chaplin's film advanced a stirring, controversial \ncondemnation of Hitler, fascism, antisemitism, and the Nazis, the latter of whom \nhe excoriates in the film as &quot;machine men, with machine minds and machine \nhearts&quot;.\n      Contents[hide]\n        1 Plot\n        2 Cast and analysis\n        3 The Jewish barber and Chaplin's classic Little Tramp character\n        4 Making of the film\n        5 Reception\n        6 Score\n        7 Lawsuit\n        8 See also\n        9 Notes\n        10 Additional references\n        11 External links\n\n\n[edit] PlotThis article's plot summary may be too long or excessively \n      detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and \n      making it more concise. (January 2010)\n\nThe film begins during a battle of World War I. The protagonist is an unnamed \nJewish private (Charlie Chaplin), a barber by profession and is fighting for the \nCentral Powers in the army of the fictional nation of Tomainia (an allusion to \nptomaine poisoning), comically blundering through the trenches in a tract of \ncombat scenes. Upon hearing a fatigued pilot pleading for help, the private \nvaliantly attempts to rescue the exhausted officer, Commander Schultz (Reginald \nGardiner). The two board Schultz's nearby airplane and fly off, escaping enemy \nfire in the nick of time. Schultz reveals that he is carrying important \ndispatches that could win the Tomainian war. However, the plane quickly loses \nfuel and crashes in a marsh. Both Schultz and the private survive. As medics \narrive, Commander Schultz gives them the dispatches, but is told that the war \nhas just ended and Tomainia lost.\nThe scene cuts to victory celebrations, newspaper headlines, the hospitalization \nand release of the private, and to a speech given twenty years later by Adenoid \nHynkel (cf. Adolf Hitler, also played by Chaplin in a double role), now the \nruthless dictator of Tomainia, who has undertaken an endeavor to persecute Jews \nthroughout the land, aided by Minister of the Interior Garbitsch (compare Joseph \nGoebbels, played by Henry Daniell) and Minister of War Herring (compare Hermann \nGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring, played by Billy Gilbert). The symbol of Hynkel's fascist regime is the \n&quot;double cross&quot; (compare the Nazi swastika) and Hynkel himself speaks a dramatic, \nmacaronic parody of the German language (reminiscent of Hitler's own fiery \nspeeches), &quot;translated&quot; at humorously obvious parts in the speech by an overly \nconcise English-speaking news voice-over.\n \nChaplin as &quot;The Phooey&quot;, Adenoid HynkelThe Jewish private and barber, who had \nbeen hospitalized for the past twenty years, having suffered memory loss from \nthe plane crash, is blissfully unaware of Hynkel's rise to power and now, at \nlast, returns to his barbershop in the Jewish ghetto, shocked when storm \ntroopers paint &quot;Jew&quot; on the windows of his shop. In the ensuing slapstick \nscuffle with the stormtroopers, Hannah (Paulette Goddard), a beautiful resident \nof the ghetto, knocks both Stormtroopers on the head with a frying pan. The \nbarber finds a friend and ultimately a love interest in Hannah. Soon, the barber \nis almost lynched by Stormtroopers, but is saved when Commander Schultz, now a \nhigh official in Hynkel's government, intervenes. Meanwhile, Schultz recognizes \nthe barber (who is reminded of WWI by Schultz and therefore gets his memory \nback) and, though surprised to find him a Jew, Schultz orders the storm troopers \nto leave him and Hannah alone.\nHynkel, in addition, has relaxed his stance on Tomainian Jewry in an attempt to \nwoo a Jewish financier into giving him a loan to support his regime. Egged on by \nGarbitsch, Hynkel has become obsessed with the idea of world domination. In one \nfamous scene, Hynkel dances with a large, inflatable globe, while thinking of \nbeing Emperor of the world to the tune of the Prelude to Act I of Richard \nWagner's Lohengrin at the end of which it suddenly pops in his hands, like a \nballoon. This seemed to be a premonition of the end of his regime and his \nunfulfilled ambitions sooner or later.\nOn Garbitsch's advice, Hynkel has planned to invade the neighboring country of \nOsterlich (likely a corruption of ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œsterreich, the German name for Austria) and \nneeds the loan to finance the invasion. The financier refuses, and Hynkel \nreinstates his persecution of the Jews, this time to an even greater extent. \nSchultz voices his objection to the pogrom and shows his empathy towards Jews; \nHynkel denounces Schultz as a supporter of democracy and a traitor, and orders \nSchultz placed in a concentration camp. Schultz flees to the ghetto and begins \nplanning to overthrow the Hynkel regime.\nSchultz, along with the barber, Hannah, and other members of the ghetto, meet to \ndiscuss their subversive plot. Schultz says that in order to decide who will \ncarry out this plot (which involves a suicide mission to blow up Hynkel's \npalace), a coin will be placed in one of five puddings, and the person who \nreceives the one with the coin in it is to carry out the mission. However, \nHannah, trying to make a pacifistic statement, has placed a coin in every \ndessert, leading to one of Chaplin's most comical scenes; finally, they all \ndecide it is best to heed Hannah's advice not to attempt the suicide mission. \nEventually, however, both Schultz and the barber are captured and condemned to \nthe camp.\n \nChaplin with Jack Oakie as &quot;Benzino Napaloni&quot;Hynkel is initially opposed by \nBenzino Napaloni (a portmanteau of Benito Mussolini, Napoleon Bonaparte, and \nbenzene, played by Jack Oakie), dictator of Bacteria, in his plans to invade \nOsterlich. Hynkel invites Napaloni to talk the situation over in Tomainia, \nhowever, and attempts to impress Napaloni with a display of military might and \npsychological warfare, and thus invites Napaloni to a military show. The show \nturns out to be a disaster, totally failing to impress Napaloni. After some \nfriction and a comedic food fight between the two leaders, a deal is made. \nHynkel immediately breaks the deal, and the invasion proceeds again. Hannah, who \nhas since emigrated to Osterlich to escape Hynkel, once again finds herself \nliving under Hynkel's regime.\nSchultz and the barber escape from the camp wearing Tomainian uniforms. Border \nguards mistake the barber for Hynkel, to whom he is nearly identical in \nappearance. Conversely, Hynkel, on a duck-hunting trip, falls overboard and is \nmistaken for the barber and is arrested by his own soldiers.\nThe barber, now assuming Hynkel's identity, is taken to the Tomainian capital to \nmake a victory speech. Garbitsch, in introducing &quot;Hynkel&quot; to the throngs, \ndecries free speech and other supposedly traitorous and outdated ideas. In \ncontrast, the barber then makes a rousing speech, reversing Hynkel's \nanti-Semitic policies and declaring that Tomainia and Osterlich will now be a \nfree nation and a democracy. He also calls for humanity in general to break free \nfrom dictatorships and use science and progress to make the world better \ninstead.[2]\nHannah, who was previously mistreated by Tomainian police agents looking for the \nbarber, hears the barber's speech on the radio, and is amazed when &quot;Hynkel&quot; \naddresses her directly: &quot;Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up, \nHannah. The clouds are lifting. The sun is breaking through. We are coming out \nof the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world, a kindlier \nworld, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and brutality. Look up, \nHannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to \nfly. He is flying into the rainbowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½into the light of hope, into the future, the \nglorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. \nLook up&quot;. Hannah looks up with an optimistic smile.[3]\n[edit] Cast and analysis \nChaplin (as the barber) absent-mindedly attempts to shave Goddard (as Hannah) in \nthis image from the trailer for the film.The film stars Chaplin in a double role \nas the Jewish barber, and as the fascist dictator (or &quot;Phooey&quot;, parodying \n&quot;FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrer&quot;) Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, clearly modeled on Adolf Hitler. The \nJewish barber has the bowler hat, cane, and moustache of Chaplin's famous Tramp \ncharacter, though early in the film's production Chaplin insisted the barber was \nnot the tramp. Also featured in the cast are Paulette Goddard as Hannah, Jack \nOakie as Napaloni, Reginald Gardiner as Schultz, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch and \nBilly Gilbert as Field Marshal Herring, an incompetent adviser to Hynkel.\nThe names of the aides of Hynkel are parodies of those of Hitler's. Garbitsch \n(pronounced &quot;garbage&quot;), the right hand man of Hynkel, is a parody of Joseph \nGoebbels, and Field Marshal Herring was modeled after the Luftwaffe chief, \nHermann GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring. The &quot;Dig-a-ditchy&quot; of Bacteria, Benzino Napaloni, was modeled \nafter Italy's Il Duce, Benito Mussolini. Benzino is played with arrogant \nbuffoonery by Jack Oakie.\nMuch of the film is taken up by Hynkel and Napaloni arguing over the fate of \nOsterlich (Austria). Originally, Mussolini was opposed to the German takeover \nsince he saw Austria as a buffer-state between Germany and Italy. The \ninternational community (in particular, France and Britain, Mussolini's Stresa \nfront partners) did not share Italy's concern over German annexation of Austria \nand supported League of Nations sanctions against Italy, after Italy invaded \nEthiopia. In 1936, Mussolini submitted to Hitler's will, withdrew Italian troops \nfrom the Brenner Pass along the Austrian border, and moved closer to Germany, as \nHitler did not apply sanctions against Italy. This conflict is almost forgotten \ntoday given Italy's alliance with the German Third Reich during World War II.\nThe film contains several of Chaplin's most famous sequences. The rally speech \nby Hynkel, delivered in German-sounding gibberish, is a caricature of Hitler's \noratory style, which Chaplin studied carefully in newsreels.[4] The German words \nschnitzel, sauerkraut and liverwurst (for Leberwurst) can be made out, as well \nas &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; and English phrases such as &quot;cheese'n'crackers&quot; and \nfrequently &quot;lager beer&quot;, in the fake German Hynkel speaks during the rally and \nat other points in the film when he is angry (though he normally speaks \nEnglish). Billy Gilbert as Herring is also required to improvise this fake \nGerman at times, and at one point (where he is apologizing for having \naccidentally knocked Hynkel down the stairs) he comes up with the word &quot;banana&quot;. \nChaplin is clearly taken by surprise and repeats, &quot;Der banana?&quot; before \nincorporating the word into his own reply. Chaplin, as Hynkel, has a tendency to \nremove Herring's medals when he gets angry. In the scene where Hynkel receives \nnews that Napaloni mobilized his troops along the Osterlich border, Hynkel not \nonly removed all of Herring's medals, but removed all of his buttons on his \nshirt, revealing a striped shirt with suspenders and then slaps Herring.\nChaplin, as the barber, shaves a customer in tune with a radio broadcast of \nJohannes Brahms's Hungarian Dance No. 5, recorded in one continuous shot. The \nfilm's most celebrated sequence is the ballet dance between Hynkel and a balloon \nglobe in his palatial office, set to Richard Wagner's Lohengrin Overture, which \nis also used at the end of the film when the Jewish barber is making the victory \nspeech in Hynkel's place. The globe dance had its origins in the late 1920s, \nwhen Chaplin was filmed at a Hollywood party doing an early version of the \ndance, with a globe and a Prussian military helmet (this footage appears in the \ndocumentary Unknown Chaplin).\nThe film ends with the barber, having been mistaken for the dictator, delivering \nan address in front of a large audience and over the radio to the nation, \nfollowing the Tomainian take-over of Osterlich (a reference to the German \nAnschluss of Austria on March 12, 1938). The address is widely interpreted as an \nout-of-character personal plea from Chaplin.\nThe Third Reich's official taste in art and architecture is frequently parodied. \nThe distance between the front door and Hynkel's desk is ridiculously long, and \nwhile a painter and a sculptor try to create his official image, the dictator \nnever stays posed for more than a few seconds at a time. In the main \nthoroughfare of the capital the Venus de Milo has been &quot;repaired&quot; to give a Nazi \nsalute, and Rodin's The Thinker still sits, but now also has his arm raised.\nSome of the signs in the shop windows of the ghettoized Jewish population in the \nfilm are written in Esperanto, a language which Hitler condemned as a Jewish \nplot to internationalize and destroy German culture.[5]\nGarbitsch, who constantly counsels and advises Hynkel, seems to be the one \nguiding him. This is an allusion to the rumors that Goebbels was the actual \nruler and Hitler only a puppet-leader.\n[edit] The Jewish barber and Chaplin's classic Little Tramp characterThere is no \nconsensus on the relationship between the film's Jewish barber and Chaplin's \nearlier Tramp character, but the trend is to view the barber as a variation on \nthe theme. Famed French film director Francois Truffaut noted that early in the \nproduction, Chaplin said he would not play The Tramp in a sound film, and he \nconsiders the barber an entirely different character.[6] However, Turner Classic \nMovies says that years later, Chaplin acknowledged a connection between the \nbarber and The Tramp. Specifically, &quot;There is some debate as to whether the \nunnamed Jewish barber is intended as the Tramp's final incarnation. Although his \nmemoirs frequently refer to the barber as the Little Tramp, Chaplin said in 1937 \nthat he would not play the Little Tramp in his sound pictures.&quot;[7] In his review \nof the film, Roger Ebert says that &quot;Chaplin was technically not playing the \nTramp&quot;, but Ebert also states that, &quot;He [Chaplin] put the Little Tramp and $1.5 \nmillion of his own money on the line to ridicule Hitler&quot;.[8]\nCritics who view the barber as different include Stephen Weissman, whose book \nChaplin: A Life speaks of Chaplin here &quot;abandoning traditional pantomime \ntechnique and his little tramp character.&quot;[9] DVD reviewer Mark Bourne bows to \nChaplin's earlier statement: &quot;Granted, the barber bears more than a passing \nresemblance to the Tramp, even affecting the familiar bowler hat and cane. But \nChaplin was clear that the barber is not the Tramp and The Great Dictator is not \na Tramp movie.&quot;[10] The Scarecrow Movie Guide also views the barber as \ndifferent.[11]\nHowever, Annette Insdorf, in her book Indelible Shadows: Film and the Holocaust, \nwrites that &quot;There was something curiously appropriate about the little tramp \nimpersonating the dictator, for by 1939 Hitler and Chaplin were perhaps the two \nmost famous men in the world. The tyrant and the tramp reverse roles in The \nGreat Dictator, permitting the eternal outsider to address the masses...&quot;[12] \nSimilarly, in The 50 Greatest Jewish Movies, Kathryn Bernheimer writes, &quot;What he \nchose to say in The Great Dictator, however, was just what one might expect from \nthe Little Tramp. Film scholars have often noted that the Little Tramp resembles \na Jewish stock figure, the ostracized outcast, an outsider...&quot;[13]\nSeveral reviewers speak of a morphing of The Little Tramp into the Jewish \nbarber. In Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s, Thomas Schatz writes of \n&quot;Chaplin's Little Tramp transposed into a meek Jewish barber&quot;,[14] while, in \nHollywood in Crisis: Cinema and American Society, 1929-1939, Colin Shindler \nwrites that &quot;The universal Little Tramp is transmuted into a specifically Jewish \nbarber whose country is about to be absorbed into the totalitarian empire of \nAdenoid Hynckel.&quot;[15] Finally, in A Distant Technology: Science Fiction Film and \nthe Machine Age, J. P. Telotte writes that &quot;The little tramp figure is here \nreincarnated as the Jewish barber&quot;.[16]\nA full two-page discussion of the relationship between the barber and The Tramp \nappears in Eric L. Flom's book Chaplin in the Sound Era: An Analysis of the \nSeven Talkies in which he concludes:\n  Perhaps the distinction between the two characters would be more clear if \n  Chaplin hadn't relied on some element of confusion to attract audiences to the \n  picture. With The Great Dictator's twist of mistaken identity, the similarity \n  between the Barber and the Tramp allowed Chaplin break [sic] with his old \n  persona in the sense of characterization, but to capitalize on him in a visual \n  sense. The similar nature of the Tramp and Barber characterizations may have \n  been an effort by Chaplin to maintain his popularity with filmgoers, many of \n  whom by 1940 had never seen a silent picture during the silent era. Chaplin \n  may have created a new character form the old, but he nonetheless counted on \n  the Charlie person to bring audiences into the theaters for his first foray \n  into sound, and his boldest political statement to date.[17]\n[edit] Making of the filmThe film was directed by Chaplin (with his half-brother \nWheeler Dryden as assistant director), and also written and produced by Chaplin. \nThe film was shot largely at the Chaplin Studios and other locations around Los \nAngeles. The elaborate World War I scenes were filmed in Laurel Canyon. Chaplin \nand Meredith Willson composed the music. Filming began in September 1939 and \nfinished six months later. Chaplin was motivated by the escalating violence and \nrepression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of \nwhich was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow \nartists. The Third Reich's repressive nature and militarist tendencies were also \nwell-known at the time. However, Chaplin later stated that he would not have \nmade the film if he had known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes.[1]\nChaplin also may have been inspired by a film his other half-brother Sydney \nChaplin directed and starred in, called King, Queen, Joker (1921). Syd, like \nCharlie, played a dual role of a barber and ruler of a country who is about to \nbe overthrown. According to Janiss Garza, Chaplin was sued in the 1940s over \nplagiarism problems with The Great Dictator. Apparently neither the suing party \nnor Chaplin himself brought up his own brother's King, Queen, Joker of twenty \nyears before.[18][19]\nSeveral similarities between Hitler and Chaplin have been noted and may have \nbeen a pivotal factor in Chaplin's decision to make The Great Dictator. Chaplin \nand Hitler had superficially similar looks, most famously their toothbrush \nmustaches, and this similarity is often commented upon. (Tommy Handley wrote a \nsong named &quot;Who is This Man Who Looks like Charlie Chaplin?&quot;[20]) Furthermore, \nthe two men were born only four days apart in April 1889, and both grew up in \nrelative poverty with alcoholic fathers and ailing mothers. Both were great fans \nof composer Richard Wagner.\nAs Hitler and his Nazi Party rose to prominence, Chaplin's popularity throughout \nthe world became greater than ever; he was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to \nBerlin, which annoyed the Nazis, who published a book in 1934 titled The Jews \nAre Looking at You, in which the comedian was described as &quot;a disgusting Jewish \nacrobat&quot; (despite the fact that Chaplin was not Jewish). Ivor Montagu, a close \nfriend of Chaplin, relates that he sent Chaplin a copy of the book and always \nbelieved this was the genesis of Dictator.[21]\nCharlie Chaplin's son Charles Chaplin, Jr. describes how his father was haunted \nby the similar backgrounds of Hitler and himself. He writes,\n  Their destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the \n  other was to set the whole world laughing. Dad could never think of Hitler \n  without a shudder, half of horror, half of fascination. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust think,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he would \n  say uneasily, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the madman, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m the comic. But it could have been the \n  other way around.[22]\nChaplin prepared the story throughout 1938 and 1939, and began filming in \nSeptember 1939, one week after the beginning of World War II. He finished \nfilming almost six months later. The 2002 TV documentary on the making of the \nfilm, The Tramp and the Dictator,[23] presented newly discovered footage of the \nfilm production (shot by Chaplin's elder half-brother Sydney) which showed \nChaplin's initial attempts at the film's ending, filmed before the fall of \nFrance.[1]\nThe making of the film coincided with rising tensions throughout the world. \nSpeculation grew that this and other anti-fascist films such as The Mortal Storm \nand Four Sons would remain unreleased, given the United States' neutral \nrelationship with Germany. The project continued largely because Chaplin was \nfinancially and artistically independent of other studios; also, failure to \nrelease the film would have bankrupted Chaplin, who had invested $1.5 million of \nhis own money in the project. The film eventually opened in New York City in \nSeptember 1940, to a wider American audience in October, and the United Kingdom \nin December. The film was released in France in April 1945.\nWhen interviewed about this film being on such a touchy subject, Charlie Chaplin \nhad only this to say: &quot;Half-way through making The Great Dictator I began \nreceiving alarming messages from United Artists ... but I was determined to go \nahead, for Hitler must be laughed at.&quot; The documentary The Tramp and The \nDictator provides audio of a 1983 interview with Chaplin associate Dan James, in \nwhich he reports that President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent his adviser Harry \nHopkins to personally meet with Chaplin and encourage him to move ahead with the \nfilm.\nAccording to The Tramp and the Dictator, the film was not only sent to Hitler, \nbut an eyewitness confirmed he saw it.[1] This allegation has however, been \ndenied by Hitler's architect Albert Speer.[24] According to the Internet Movie \nDatabase, Chaplin, after being told Hitler saw the movie, replied: &quot;I'd give \nanything to know what he thought of it.&quot;[25] Hitler's response is not recorded \nbut he is said to have viewed the film twice.[26]\n[edit] ReceptionThe film was well received at the time of its release, and was \npopular with the American public. The film was also popular in the United \nKingdom, drawing 9 million to the theatres.[27] Jewish audiences were deeply \nmoved by the portrayal of Jewish characters and their plight, which was still a \ntaboo subject in Hollywood films of the time.\nWhen the film was in production, the British government announced that it would \nprohibit its exhibition in the United Kingdom in keeping with its appeasement \npolicy concerning Nazi Germany. However, by the time the film was released, the \nUK was at war with Germany and the film was now welcomed in part for its obvious \npropaganda value. In 1941, London's Prince of Wales Theatre screened its UK \npremiere. The film had been banned in many parts of Europe, and the theatre's \nowner, Alfred Esdaile, was apparently fined for showing it.[28] It eventually \nbecame Chaplin's highest grossing film.\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he would not have been able to \nmake such jokes about the Nazi regime had the extent of the Nazi horrors been \nknown, particularly the death camps and the Holocaust. While Ernst Lubitsch's \n1942 To Be or Not To Be dealt with similar themes (even including another \nmistaken-identity Hitler figure), after the scope of Nazi atrocities became \napparent it took nearly twenty years before any other films dared to satirize \nthe era.[29] Mel Brooks' The Producers (1968) mocked Nazis (though not their \nactions- Brooks would also later remake To Be or Not To Be). The television \nseries Hogan's Heroes also represented later comedic takes on the era, as did \nthe 1997 Italian film Life is Beautiful.\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards:\n  Outstanding Production ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ United Artists (Charlie Chaplin, Producer)\n  Best Actor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Charlie Chaplin\n  Best Writing (Original Screenplay) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Charlie Chaplin\n  Best Supporting Actor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jack Oakie\n  Best Music (Original Score) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Meredith Willson\nIn 1997, The Great Dictator was selected for preservation in the United States \nNational Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, \nhistorically or aesthetically significant&quot;.\nThe film was Chaplin's first true talking picture and helped shake off \naccusations of Luddism following his previous release, the mostly dialogue-free \nModern Times, released in 1936 when the silent era had all but ended in the late \n1920s. The Great Dictator does, however, feature several silent scenes more \nin-keeping with Chaplin's previous films. To add to that, some audiences had \ncome to expect Chaplin to make silent films even during the sound era.[30] Some \naudiences nicknamed him the &quot;Silent Clown&quot; during the height of the silent era.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\n  2000: AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs #37\n[edit] ScoreThe score was written and directed by Meredith Willson, later to \nbecome well-known as creator of the 1957 musical comedy The Music Man.[31] \nWillson wrote:\n  I've seen [Chaplin] take a sound track and cut it all up and paste it back \n  together and come up with some of the dangdest effects you ever heardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½effects \n  a composer would never think of. Don't kid yourself about that one. He would \n  have been great at anything ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ music, law, ballet dancing, or painting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ house, \n  sign, or portrait. I got the screen credit for The Great Dictator music score, \n  but the best parts of it were all Chaplin's ideas, like using the Lohengrin \n  &quot;Prelude&quot; in the famous balloon-dance scene.[32]\n \nChaplin in the globe sceneWhile it is frequently noted that Chaplin used \nWagner's Lohengrin prelude in the scene where dictator Hynckel dances with the \nglobe-balloon, it is far less frequently noted that the same music is used near \nthe conclusion of the Jewish barber's speech celebrating democracy and \nfreedom.[33] In the first case, the music does not reach a conclusion, since the \nglobe-balloon pops. In the latter case, the Lohengrin music continues to its \nfinal climax as the barber over the radio tells Hannah to look up at the sun, \nand promises that mankind is 'flying into the rainbow, the hope, the future'. As \nnoted above, Chaplin's son has written about how Chaplin was haunted by the \nsimilarities between Hitler's background and his, including their common love \nfor the music of Richard Wagner.\nAccording to Willson, the scene in which Chaplin shaves a customer to Brahms' \nHungarian Dance No. 5 had been filmed before he arrived, using a phonograph \nrecord for timing. Willson was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, \nfitting the music to the action. They had planned to do it painstakingly, \nrecording eight measures or less at a time, after running through the whole \nscene to get the overall idea. Chaplin decided to record the runthrough in case \nanything was usable, and &quot;by dumb luck we had managed to catch every movement, \nand that was the first and only 'take' made of the scene, the one used in the \nfinished picture&quot;.[32]\n[edit] LawsuitThe film was the subject of a plagiarism lawsuit (Bercovici v. \nChaplin) in 1947 against Chaplin. The case was settled, with Chaplin paying \nKonrad Bercovici $95,000.[34] In his autobiography, Chaplin insisted that he had \nbeen the sole writer of the movie's script. He came to a settlement, though, \nbecause of his &quot;unpopularity in the States at that moment and being under such \ncourt pressure, [he] was terrified, not knowing what to expect next.&quot;[35]\n[edit] See alsoLook-alike\n  You Nazty Spy! and I'll Never Heil Again, a pair of Three Stooges shorts with \n  a similar subject matter, with the former being released nine months before \n  The Great Dictator.\n  Der Fuehrer's Face.
