It is one of the more popular of the CLAMP series and often shows other CLAMP series being mentioned (ex. Chobits, Sakura Chronicles).\n\nIt revolves around a boy named Watanuki and how he stumbled upon a shop owned by a woman named Yuuko. Yuuko's power is to grant wishes, but she can only do so with proper payment. Since Watanuki has seen spirits ever since he was born, Yuuko offers to take away his sight of the spirits in exchange for him working at the shop. He agrees and works at the shop until his debt is repaid.\n\nJapanese title: xxxHolicÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ã§Â±Â \nType: Manga\nVolumes: 19\nChapters: 213\nStatus: Finished\nPublished: Feb 24, 2003 to Feb 9, 2011\nGenres: Comedy, Mystery, Drama, Magic, Supernatural\nAuthors: CLAMP (Story &amp; Art)\nSerialization: Bessatsu Shounen Magazine\nFormat: PDF\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: BakaBT\nScanlating Groups: Be With You Scans, Binktopia, Fail Manga, Franky House\n\nChapters' bookmarks included.\n\nIn Vol. 15, you'll notice that next chapter after 94. is 174. - this is not a mistake. First 94 chapters were scanlated by BWYS and their source was a tankÃ…ï¿½bon, where chapter numebers are different (some chapters are more than 60 pages long, while the usual number of pages per chapter is around 20 in most cases), while the other chapters were scanlated from &quot;Bessatsu Shounen&quot; and &quot;Young&quot; magazines.\n\nThat's why, instead of changing chapter numebers, I went with numbers provided by scanlating groups.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2890&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2890&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myanimelist.net/manga/10/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myanimelist.net/manga/10/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=341&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=341&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ffc811317a2d6b0f3d0c7b2ffd92c03112cb58","amp;dn":"%5BManga+Motome%5D+xxxHOLiC+%282003%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ffc811317a2d6b0f3d0c7b2ffd92c03112cb58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,255,200,17,49,122,45,107,15,61,12,123,47,253,146,192,49,18,203,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
