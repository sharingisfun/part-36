Two assassins Soul and Shang, find a window of opportunity to strike while all their enemies can be found in one place. Their mission is simple: take down all their enemies or die in the attempt. They will face many challenges and discover lost secrets as they embark on a perilous journey against terrible odds.\n\nTake control of Soul and Shang and wield two separate martial arts styles to defeat their foes.\n\nSoul is an orphan born with the temperament of a master.

He favors Dark Wound, a short bladed weapon given to him by his adoptive father, rumored to be one of the Night Masters..\n\nShang Zuo is a calm, unflappable fighter of average skill, but who possesses a centered view of all things powerful enough to influence physical objects.
