Finessing his way through immigration, he spends a few restless weeks as the very unwelcome guest in his cousin's home before tracking down Shingi in a squat. This shocking, powerful first novel is the story of a stranger in a strange landÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the thousands of illegal Zimbabwean immigrants seeking a better lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€with a past he is determined to hide. From the first line the language fizzes with energy, humor, and not a little menace. As he struggles to make his life in London (the &quot;Harare North&quot; of the title) and battles with the weight of what he has left behind in a strife-torn Zimbabwe, every expectation and preconception is turned on its head. The inhabitants of the squat function at various levels of desperation: Shingi struggles to find meaningful work and to meet the demands of his family back home; Tsitsi makes a living renting out her baby to women defrauding Social Services; Alex claims to have an important job in Croydon. Fearlessly political, laugh-out-loud funny, and with an anti-hero whose voice is impossible to forget, this novel is an arresting account of London as it is experienced by Africa's dispossessed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87cfd5b8e7c25c71568bfaf1793db6f8b26f0bf6","amp;dn":"Harare+North+by+Brian+Chikwava+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87cfd5b8e7c25c71568bfaf1793db6f8b26f0bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,207,213,184,231,194,92,113,86,139,250,241,121,61,182,248,178,111,11,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
