Initially they called themselves \\\\\\&quot;The Dust Brothers\\\\\\&quot;, after the noted United States production duo of the same name, but their burgeoning popularity and the threat of legal action from the originals led them to change their name in 1995. Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method and the highly regarded Beastie Boys, as well as other lesser-known acts they were pioneers of the big beat electronic dance genre, and are known for high-quality live sets.\n\nFormat: AVI (MPEG-2 Video)\nGender: Big beat\nTime: 3.43 min\nFile size: 114 MB\nVideo resolution: 720x576\nVideo Bit Rate: 5000 Kb/s 25fr./sek.\nSound Bit Rate: 192 Kb/s 48 KHz AC3 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d99b1111ebf046ede743edb215677e46a103ccce","amp;dn":"The+Chemical+Brothers+-+Hey+Boy+Hey+Girl+%281999%29+%5B.avi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d99b1111ebf046ede743edb215677e46a103ccce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,155,17,17,235,240,70,237,231,67,237,178,21,103,126,70,161,3,204,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
