And Dreena Burton, author of the bestselling The Everyday Vegan, is here to tell you how the decision to Ã¢â‚¬Å“go greenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean you have to sacrifice nutrition or flavor, and in fact will make you and your family feel healthier and more alive.\n\nDreena and her husband became parents three years ago, and their decision to raise their daughter as a vegan from birth has made the need for an animal-free diet that is fully nutritional all the more crucial. But as Dreena demonstrates in Vive le Vegan!, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no need to panic: there are simple methods and delectable ingredients you can use that will allow youÃ¢â‚¬â€whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re single or have a familyÃ¢â‚¬â€to become vegan without having to be a rocket scientist. And who said that vegan meals lack pizzazz? Not when you can make:\n\nBerry Hemp Smoothies\nFresh Jicama and Cucumber Slaw\nHearty Roasted Tomato Stew\nCarrot-Shitake Spring Rolls\nChipotle Veggie Bean Burritos\nMorrocan Chickpea Patties\nApple Cardomom Cake with Creamy Lemon Maple Frosting\n\nThe recipes in Vive le Vegan! also donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t over-rely on the use of soy, given recent concerns about over--consumption, and many feature whole grains and hemp. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also disarmingly easy to prepare. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to give up your qualms about the vegan lifestyle and celebrate its vivid possibilities. Vive le vegan!\n\nDreena Burton is the author of The Everyday Vegan, now in its second printing. She lives in White Rock, British Columbia, with her husband, Paul, and their three year-old daughter, Charlotte","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ceeb0b99e9da61d1d65c3501487bc59930da50","amp;dn":"Vive+le+Vegan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ceeb0b99e9da61d1d65c3501487bc59930da50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,206,235,11,153,233,218,97,209,214,92,53,1,72,123,197,153,48,218,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
