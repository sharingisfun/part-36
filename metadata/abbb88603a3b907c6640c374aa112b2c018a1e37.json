William James was a psychologist and, as such, his interest in religion was not that of a theologian but of a scientist. In these 20 lectures, he discusses the nature and origin of religious belief.\nThe average believer is one who has inherited his religion, but this will not do for James's inquiry. He must find those believers who have a voracious religious faith because these people have also often experienced a number of peculiar psychological episodes, including having visions, hearing voices, and falling into trances.\nStudents of psychology and those interested in the mental process of belief will find these lectures informative.\nPublic Domain (P)2011 Tantor\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abbb88603a3b907c6640c374aa112b2c018a1e37","amp;dn":"The+Varieties+of+Religious+Experience+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abbb88603a3b907c6640c374aa112b2c018a1e37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,187,136,96,58,59,144,124,102,64,195,116,170,17,43,44,1,138,30,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
