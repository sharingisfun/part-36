When his brother commits suicide, Abel seeks refuge in the apartment of an old acquaintance Professor Veregus. Desperate to make ends meet in the war-ravaged city, Abel takes a job in Veregus' clinic, where he discovers the horrific truth behind the work of the strangely beneficent professor and unlocks the chilling mystery that drove his brother to kill himself.\n\n\nLanguages: English / German\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c6bf0cc09ad619a65e8a31312e0cbf8634f3643","amp;dn":"The+Serpent+s+Egg+1977+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c6bf0cc09ad619a65e8a31312e0cbf8634f3643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,107,240,204,9,173,97,154,101,232,163,19,18,224,203,248,99,79,54,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
