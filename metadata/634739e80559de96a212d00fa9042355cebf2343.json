The album came three years after its second album, Dirty Weaponry. Nearly half the album was produced by the group's beat maker 4th Disciple, with additional production provided by group affiliates Falling Down and Rebel Dainja, as well as underground production duo The Infinite Arkatechz. Fear, Love &amp; War features guest appearances from Wu-Tang Clan member U-God, Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Prodigal Sunn, Frukwan, Lord Superb and Polite. The album features the singles &quot;Feel It&quot; b/w &quot;Militant&quot; and &quot;Street Monopoly&quot; b/w &quot;Monster.&quot;\n\nWhile the album did not sell as well as the group's first two efforts, it received some critical acclaim, partly due to more mature, personal lyrical content, providing balance to the group's dark production and violent combat imagery.\n\n1 &quot;Intro&quot;  \n2 &quot;The Push&quot; \n3 &quot;Militant&quot;  \n4 &quot;Originators&quot; \n5 &quot;Skit&quot;  \n6 &quot;Sweatshop&quot;  \n7 &quot;Street Monopoly&quot;  \n8 &quot;After Hours Part 1&quot; \n9 &quot;Trilogy&quot; \n10 &quot;Feel It&quot; \n11 &quot;Skit&quot;  *Interlude* \n12 &quot;Whatever We Want&quot; \n13 &quot;Skit&quot;  *Interlude* \n14 &quot;Monster&quot; \n15 &quot;The Hit&quot; \n16 &quot;One To Grow On&quot; \n17 &quot;Skit&quot;  \n18 &quot;Day One&quot; \n19 &quot;Spoken Word&quot;   \n20 &quot;Nonchalantly&quot; \n21 &quot;The Rule&quot; \n22 &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634739e80559de96a212d00fa9042355cebf2343","amp;dn":"Killarmy+-+Fear%2C+Love+and+War+%5BGW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634739e80559de96a212d00fa9042355cebf2343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,71,57,232,5,89,222,150,162,18,208,15,169,4,35,85,206,191,35,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
