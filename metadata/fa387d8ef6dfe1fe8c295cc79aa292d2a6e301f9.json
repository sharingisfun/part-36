The author presents a variety of useful forms of intervention, showing how the therapist's capacity to comprehend and be empathetic with these difficult borderline, narcissistic, and schizoid personality disorders is limited by his or her ability to understand the meaning of the patient's behaviour. The text shows the clinician how to translate the language of the personality disorder, turning theory into clinical practice.\n\nDr. Philip Manfield has practiced psychotherapy as an MFT in the S.F. Bay area since 1975. He has authored or edited four books and numerous articles about psychotherapy and EMDR. An international trainer and consultant, he has taught in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia and the Middle East","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa387d8ef6dfe1fe8c295cc79aa292d2a6e301f9","amp;dn":"Philip+Manfield%3A+Split+Self%2FSplit+Object","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa387d8ef6dfe1fe8c295cc79aa292d2a6e301f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,56,125,142,246,223,225,254,140,41,92,199,154,162,146,210,166,227,1,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
