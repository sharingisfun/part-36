Now, ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS features revised examples and problems as well as newly added content that has been fine-tuned throughout to improve the clear flow of ideas. The computer plays a more prominent role than ever in generating computer graphics used to display concepts and problem sets. In this new edition, computational assistance in the form of a self contained Maple Primer has been included to encourage students to make use of such computational tools. The content has been reorganized into six parts and covers a wide spectrum of topics including Ordinary Differential Equations, Vectors and Linear Algebra, Systems of Differential Equations and Qualitative Methods, Vector Analysis, Fourier Analysis, Orthogonal Expansions, and Wavelets, and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e984eea18f7a165fea83924d0865d249f0301c3f","amp;dn":"Advanced+Engineering+Mathematics%2C+7th+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e984eea18f7a165fea83924d0865d249f0301c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,132,238,161,143,122,22,95,234,131,146,77,8,101,210,73,240,48,28,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
