Compiled by Michael Newton, author of the acclaimed Encyclopedia of Cryptozoology, it is the first comprehensive guide covering the crossroads of zoology and folklore written for both the young and the young at heart.\n\nOrganized by type of creature type, such as giant animals, missing links, and living fossils, Hidden Animals surveys various beings reported and pursued worldwide from ancient times to the present, in every corner of the globe. In the process, it relates classic myths and legends to identified flesh-and-blood animals. Readers will be captivated by both the scientific evidence supporting the existence of specific cryptids and the exposure of notorious frauds or cases of mistaken identity.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 200 pages\n# Publisher: Greenwood (September 10, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0313359067\n# ISBN-13: 978-0313359064","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c4ff353b9a3fab080443e29ff4ae1bbebe0989","amp;dn":"Hidden+Animals+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c4ff353b9a3fab080443e29ff4ae1bbebe0989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,196,255,53,59,154,63,171,8,4,67,226,159,244,174,27,190,190,9,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
