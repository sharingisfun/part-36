While the latter disc is based around acoustic guitar and confessional songwriting the former shows the flip side of Conor Obersts personality.  The songs are darker, more observational and offer a critique of the banal superficiality inherent in modern capitalism.  The sparse electronic production creates an eerie sense of distored perception that echos the lyrical themes.  \n\nSource: CD\nReleased: 2005\nLabel: Saddle Creek Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n  1.
