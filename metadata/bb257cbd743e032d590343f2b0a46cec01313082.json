He will talk with Alex about the latest open border scheme -- the proposal for an entry point on the Mexican border without border patrol agents. \n\nAlex also talks with pharmacist and radio talk show host [and one of Alex's partners in his supplement marketing business, infowarsteam.com] Ben Fuchs. \n\nAlex confronts the latest news, including the arrest of a &quot;right-wing&quot; family on cattle rustling charges in North Dakota. The arrests were made by local law enforcement with the help of U.S. Air Force Predator drones, a clear violation of Posse Comitatus.\n\n[Technically, the drones belong to the Border Patrol.]\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
