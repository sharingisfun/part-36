Please consider donating to them to support new projects.\nI've uploaded not only to give them a little boost to their publicity, but to keep their work alive for a while longer.  I loved playing these as a kid, even though they weren't super great works of art.\n\n___\n\n\nGames included:\n\nPac-Pack\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy: Resurrection\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy 2\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy 2, part 2: Pagoon\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy: Atomic edition\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy: Christmas edition\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy: The Lost Levels\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Gal\nÃ¢â€Å“ Pac-Guy: Scramble\nÃ¢â€â€ Pixel-Guy\nPac-Guy: Pacula's Curse\nPea-Guy: Vengeance or Bust\nPea-Guy: A-Sock-Ellipse Now!\nPea-Guy: R.I.Pea-Guy\n\nTotal unpacked size: ~1.21GB\nPacked size: ~887MB\n\n\nSystem requirements:  Pretty much anything newer than 1996.\n\n\nInformation, screenshots, and official download: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://monkeytheater.com/2011/04/astral-entertainment-free-games/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://monkeytheater.com/2011/04/astral-entertainment-free-games/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n__\n\n\n\nSupport quoted from Garth Thompson, of Monkey With a Mustache Entertainment (formerly Astral Entertainment):\n\n1. Some of these games have a primitive form of copy protection. You will notice this if it says you need to have the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CD in your CD-ROM drive to play. To get around this problem, either burn the game files to a CD, or copy them to a thumb drive, and have that in while playing. The game files including the main menu executable, autorun.inf and all other files must be in the root (i.e. not a subfolder) of the CD or the thumb drive for this trick to work.\n\n2. Any of the actual 3D games are unlikely to work properly outside of the Win 98 to Win XP bubble. You might have a chance if you mess with the compatibility mode: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows Also try searching the internet for tricks/emulation to run Win XP games in your particular OS.\n\n3. Unless you are running a 10 year old computer, do not install any of the software these games prompt you to (such as media player, DirectX, etc.) You will not need it, and it might even mess something up with an old version. This only will be a problem with the movie on A-Sock-Ellipse Now!, but you can run this movie from outside the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s menu. This movie is in two files called TSFK and TSFK_commentary (or something like that) and you can play them from any modern media player that supports DivX.\n\n4. On a modern computer (no matter what OS), you are likely to experience crashes in the games made in Multimedia Fusion. This is due to a compiler error in Multimedia Fusion which seems to rear itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ugly head on faster computers with modern graphics cards, moreso than slow computers with built in graphics. In the early games you have Ã¢â‚¬Å“jump to levelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the menu or by hitting Ã¢â‚¬Å“JÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, in the later games you can hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“GÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to save the game often, to get around this annoying problem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f22de539d911d4803399f6d6f33b8281949cff1","amp;dn":"%5BCyanide-X%5DAstral_Pac-Guy_%26amp%3B_Pea-Guy_Collection.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f22de539d911d4803399f6d6f33b8281949cff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,34,222,83,157,145,29,72,3,57,159,109,111,51,184,40,25,73,207,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
