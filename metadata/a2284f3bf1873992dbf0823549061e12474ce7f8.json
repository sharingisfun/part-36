Chegando lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, encontra a tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mida Fauna, irmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£ cuja existÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªncia ele desconhecia. Ela muda-se para a cabana onde ele estÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ vivendo, em meio ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  paisagem de vegetaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o densa e labirintos de riachos com pequenas ilhas. Os dois constroem uma casa sobre palafitas no meio do rio e quando a casa fica pronta, chamam os moradores locais para um jantar. Frente ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  comunidade da qual se isolaram, os irmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£os sentem a profunda reprovaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o social de seu relacionamento ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o-naturalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\nHungarian director Kornel Mundruczo (Johanna) helmed this bucolic incest-themed drama. The picture reflects on man's need to re-bond with his natural habitat, and meditates on the unseemly consequences of fraternal love that drifts into unacceptable territory. Felix Lajko stars as the unnamed protagonist, who hearkens back to his family's agrarian home after years away. Unkempt, unshaven and noticeably laconic, he makes contact with his sister (Orsi Toth of Johanna), his mother (Lili Monori) and his mother's recent husband, a brutish sociopath (Sandor Gaspar) - who uniformly toil away in a decrepit local pub. In time, the lead character and his sister move into their deceased father's abandoned property, set about constructing a house and a pier, and consummate an extremely intimate relationship as they begin to experience a more deep-seated and harmonious relationship with the natural world around them. When the others find out, however, they react in utter horror, shunning and ridiculing the couple and driving the story to a heartbreaking conclusion.
