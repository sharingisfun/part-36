During the program, CNBC takes viewers to McDonald's headquarters, test kitchens and labs, providing a close look at the immense testing and research behind every product. CNBC travels to China where McDonald's currently has 780 restaurants and is moving aggressively to expand and eclipse rival Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut. CNBC explores the highly-debated criticism McDonald's has received regarding its contribution to obesity in Americans. CNBC profiles one McDonald's store introducing its owner/franchisee, managers, employees and customers. Each of the 30,000 stores contributes to McDonald's bottom line. As you will see, running a McDonald's store is more than just flipping burgers.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 350 MiB for 45mn 4s 904ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 948 Kbps\nAspect            : 400 x 304 (1.316) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85513f3acd9b3589f36cc8120c7960b43de76c05","amp;dn":"Big+Mac%3A+Inside+the+McDonald%5C%27s+Empire+CNBC+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85513f3acd9b3589f36cc8120c7960b43de76c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,81,63,58,205,155,53,137,243,108,200,18,12,121,96,180,61,231,108,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
