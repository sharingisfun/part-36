Ã¢â‚¬Å“When it was suggested Smoke Fairies make a Christmas album the last thing we wanted to do was make a classic, jolly, celebratory album that can only be played once a year. Sometimes winter provides us with a sense of togetherness and love and sometimes it leaves us feeling alienated, cold and playing a glockenspiel alone in a darkened room. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of the year that will always be bittersweet and wild. This was the inspiration behind the record.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We got together with our band, played around with the songs a few times then headed off to the studio to record them all live. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buzzy and raw and not one tinkling of sleigh bells can be heard.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nFrom the Smoke Fairies website: Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve spent the last few months delving in childhood memories of Christmas, pondering the cold dark days of winters past and considering what it was really like to be one of the 3 magi to create our new album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWild WinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which is to be released by Full Time Hobby in conjunction with the lovely folk at Rough Trade shops who have made it their album of the month for December.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“By complete fortuity, track number 3 is called the 3 Kings and is 3.33 minutes long. To add to the 3 love and festive cheer we will be taking our winter musings out on the road, playing a trinity of shows in a trio of independent record stores.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We have a love/hate relationship with winter and the Christmas holiday.
