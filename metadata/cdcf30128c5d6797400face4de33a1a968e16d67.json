They have spent the past 2 years working tirelessly on the record and have expanded on the 2 guitar attack heard on their previous record Work Tapes. Extension Chords is a return to form so to speak as it bridges the gap between the expansive space rock of their first album Dream in Lo Fi and the post punk new wave of A Complete Record of Urban Archaeology. Fans of those earlier records should be pleasantly surprised by the space-metal prog-punk psychedelia found here. This will be one of your favorite records of the year.\nthinkingmachines.bandcamp.com\n\nTrack Listing\n----------------\n01 The Squid(2:41)\t320 kbps\t6.62 MB\n02 Gozu\t  (3:23)\t320 kbps\t8.20 MB\n03 Crisis (2:31)\t320 kbps\t6.21 MB\n04 Lunge  (2:47)\t320 kbps\t6.81 MB\n05 Kilowatt(2:42)\t320 kbps\t6.63 MB\n06 Lillian(5:30)\t320 kbps\t13.09 MB\n07 Thorax (1:50)\t320 kbps\t4.65 MB\n08 The Ghost(3:17)\t320 kbps\t7.98 MB\n09 Sophia (4:19)\t320 kbps\t10.36 MB\n10 Wallace(4:06)\t320 kbps\t9.85 MB\n11 Verb\t  (3:15)\t320 kbps\t7.89 MB\n12 Doom.React.Destroy.(6:53)\t320 kbps\t16.27 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcf30128c5d6797400face4de33a1a968e16d67","amp;dn":"Thinking+Machines+-+Extension+Chords+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcf30128c5d6797400face4de33a1a968e16d67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,207,48,18,140,93,103,151,64,15,172,228,222,51,161,169,104,225,109,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
