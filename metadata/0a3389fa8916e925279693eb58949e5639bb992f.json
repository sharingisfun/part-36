Civilization as we know it has been wiped out by a genetically engineered disease and the paranoia in the aftermath. Death counts are over millions and countries had to take drastic measures like sending nukes to their own cities. A small group of soldiers and scientists has managed to survive in a military bunker, but barely. After ten years, the group decides they can not take the boredom of sitting in the bunker anymore so they decide to investigate the surrounding area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a3389fa8916e925279693eb58949e5639bb992f","amp;dn":"Soldiers+Of+Anarchy-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a3389fa8916e925279693eb58949e5639bb992f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,51,137,250,137,22,233,37,39,150,147,235,88,148,158,86,57,187,153,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
