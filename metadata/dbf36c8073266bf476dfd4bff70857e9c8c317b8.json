The emphasis is on Latin jazz with altoist Art Pepper, trumpeter Conte Candoli, tenor saxophonist Bill Perkins, pianist Russ Freeman, bassist Ben Tucker, and drummer Chuck Flores interacting with the percussion of Jack Costanza and Mike Pacheko. With arrangements by Bill Holman, Johnny Mandel, Benny Carter, and Pepper, the music is quite jazz-oriented if a touch lightweight. Worth investigating by fans of the idiom. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Mucho Calor\n02 - Autumn Leaves\n03 - Mambo De La Pinta\n04 - I'll Remember April\n05 - Vaya Hombre Vaya\n06 - I Love You\n07 - Mambo Jumbo\n08 - Old Devil Moon\n09 - Pernod\n10 - That Old Black Magic\n\nSplit with Medieval. No I'm sorry, but too late.\nEnjoy and share!
