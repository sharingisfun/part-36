You owe it to yourself to give them a chance if you haven't already.\n\nA full write-up/review of these books is available at the Comix Joint. Just give it a search, because links to that site don't show up in PB descriptions or comments.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a3df59a86399759992cb0dfed122dc9f466312","amp;dn":"Nard+n%27+Pat+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a3df59a86399759992cb0dfed122dc9f466312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,163,223,89,168,99,153,117,153,146,203,13,254,209,34,220,159,70,99,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
