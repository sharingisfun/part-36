The book has a student-friendly pedagogical approach that carefully accounts for the strengths and weaknesses of the Java language. With this book, students will gain a solid foundation in data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and other problem-solving techniques.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7218f2530073f2a76f2d4013b4bb3ba5a3d919f0","amp;dn":"Data+Abstraction+and+Problem+Solving+with+Java+3rd+Edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7218f2530073f2a76f2d4013b4bb3ba5a3d919f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,24,242,83,0,115,242,167,111,45,64,19,180,187,59,165,163,217,25,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
