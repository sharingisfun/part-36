Good.\n\nOnce thats complete, Copy all the files inside the folder &quot;DoW2 1.8&quot; and place them into your installation directory. In my case\n&quot;E:/Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War II/DoW2/&quot; \n\nHopefully it'll all be good to go.\nFind other patches using the search bar on TPB. Just search &quot;Dawn of War patch&quot; or &quot;Dawn of War update&quot; etc. etc.\n\nHave fun and play your game!\nBtw, to get free Games for Windows LIVE Product Keys, go to your local Gamestop Retailer, and open every Games for Windows LIVE box, one is bound to have a product key. Whether or not it is for the game you want to activate, it might work. I used ONE product key on NINE Games for Windows LIVE games. It works. The product key doesn't always work for different games, but I used a &quot;Fallout 3&quot; product key on different games, and on Windows Vista and my Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade. I also used a product key for &quot;The Club&quot; about 12 times on different Windows Installations and on different games. &quot;Stormrise&quot; unfortunately did not work with any games and Stormrise is shit so I don't have it.\n\nAnyways, have fun and happy gaming!\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 -Heretic Furby\n                             &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0e7a666b6d7c6f7477433a4f3f4e776f666161206d6163&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nThis is my link for Patch 1.9.
