Set among the elegant brownstones of New York City and opulent country houses like gracious Bellomont on the Hudson, the novel creates a satiric portrayal of what Wharton herself called &quot;a society of irresponsible pleasure-seekers&quot; with a precision comparable to that of Proust. And her brilliant and complex characterization of the doomed Lily Bart, whose stunning beauty and dependence on marriage for economic survival reduce her to a decorative object, becomes an incisive commentary on the nature and status of women in that society.\nRead by Anna Fields\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n------------------------\nVisit us for more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd14937200701d8ac566518bf64162a3eaad2df5","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Mirth+-+Edith+Wharton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd14937200701d8ac566518bf64162a3eaad2df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,20,147,114,0,112,29,138,197,102,81,139,246,65,98,163,234,173,45,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
