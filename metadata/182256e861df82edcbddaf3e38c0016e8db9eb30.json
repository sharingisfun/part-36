Stevie Nicks - Insider (Xvid-2nafish)\n\n\nThis video has no logos.\n\n\nHard Promises is the fourth album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released in May, 1981. Its original working title was Benmont's Revenge. It features guest vocals from Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac on the duet &quot;Insider&quot;. They would also record the hit &quot;Stop Draggin' My Heart Around&quot; for Nicks' album Bella Donna.\n\nThis was the second Tom Petty album on the Backstreet Records label. The album's release was delayed while Petty and his distributor MCA Records argued about the list price. The album was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following Steely Dan's Gaucho and the Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra Xanadu soundtrack. This so-called &quot;superstar pricing&quot; was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album or naming it Eight Ninety-Eight were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.\n\nDuring the recording of the album John Lennon was scheduled to be in the same studio at the same time. Tom Petty was looking forward to meeting him when he came in. The meeting would never occur; unfortunately, John Lennon was murdered before he could ever make it into the studio. In order to pay tribute to one of their influences the band decided to etch &quot;WE LOVE YOU JL&quot; on the master copy of the album. To this day &quot;WE LOVE YOU JL&quot; is seen on every Hard Promises vinyl copy pressed. The album's title comes from a line in the chorus of &quot;Insider&quot;.\n\nIn February 2006, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers agreed to be the headline act at the fifth annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Following that announcement came the itinerary for Tom &amp; the Heartbreakers' &quot;30th Anniversary Tour&quot;. Special guests included Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, The Allman Brothers, Trey Anastasio, The Derek Trucks Band, and The Black Crowes (who also opened for Petty on their 2005 Summer Tour). Stevie Nicks would join Tom and the Heartbreakers on stage for renditions of &quot;Stop Draggin' My Heart Around&quot; and &quot;Insider,&quot; and &quot;I Need to Know&quot; where Nicks took the lead vocal spot. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam also joined Tom and the Heartbreakers on stage at some shows where Vedder sang the lead on &quot;The Waiting&quot; (which is available on the Runnin' Down a Dream package: bonus features) and a verse in the concert-closer &quot;American Girl&quot;.\n\nIn July 2006, Petty released a new solo album titled Highway Companion, which included the hit &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. It debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200, becoming Petty's highest chart position since the introduction of the Nielsen SoundScan system for tracking album sales in 1991. Highway Companion was briefly promoted on the &quot;30th Anniversary Tour&quot; with the Heartbreakers in 2006 with performances of &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, &quot;Square One&quot;, &quot;Down South,&quot; and &quot;Flirting with Time&quot;.\n\nIn 2006, the American Broadcasting Company hired Petty to do the music for its National Basketball Association playoffs coverage.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182256e861df82edcbddaf3e38c0016e8db9eb30","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+feat.+Stevie+Nicks+-+Insider+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182256e861df82edcbddaf3e38c0016e8db9eb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,34,86,232,97,223,130,237,203,221,175,62,56,192,1,110,141,185,235,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
