One of these attributes is the fact that a number of scientific truths that we have only been able to uncover by the technology of the 20th century were stated in the Qur&amp;#039;an 1,400 years ago. Of course the Qur&amp;#039;an is not a book of science. However, many scientific facts that are expressed in an extremely concise and profound manner in its verses have only been discovered with the technology of the 20th century. These facts could not have been known at the time of the Qur&amp;#039;an&amp;#039;s revelation, and this is still more proof that the Qur&amp;#039;an is the word of God.
