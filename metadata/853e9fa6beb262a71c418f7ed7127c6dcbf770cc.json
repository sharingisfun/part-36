It is designed to stimulate the mental, physical and emotional faculties of your child with the added benefit of enriching the parent-child relationship. Toddler yoga has been designed for children from 10 months old. Toddler yoga is great fun and can be enjoyed by the whole family, younger and older siblings as well. It encourages pre-verbal communication and enhances physical confidence. It teaches both adult and child how to relax together. Clear instructions guide the mother or father through the DVD so they can easily follow the sessions with their child or family at home. Toddlers or parents do not need to have had previous yoga experience to enjoy this DVD.\n\nToddler Yoga has been developed by the highly acclaimed yoga instructor Dr. Francoise Barbira Freedman a medical anthropologist at Cambridge University, founder of Birhtlight and mother of four. Dr Freedman lectures in midwifery and women's health for the NHS and is the founder of Birthlight, a UK based charitable trust that is dedicated to promoting a sensitive approach to pregnancy, birth and babies. Dr Freedman and other Birthlight teachers often feature in mother and baby magazines, with recent articles appearing in Yoga Journal and Mother Magazine.\n\n53 min\n\nVideo; x264; 718*566 (16:9); 1829 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz\n\n5023093053130","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:853e9fa6beb262a71c418f7ed7127c6dcbf770cc","amp;dn":"Kids+Unlimited+-+Baby+Yoga+for+Toddlers+DVDRip+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"853e9fa6beb262a71c418f7ed7127c6dcbf770cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,62,159,166,190,178,98,167,28,65,143,126,215,18,124,109,203,247,112,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
