The LP is the last Skynyrd album ever recorded by original members Ronnie Van Zant and Allen Collins, and is the sole Skynyrd studio recording by guitarist Steve Gaines. Three days after the album's release, on October 20, 1977, the band's chartered airplane crashed en route to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, killing the pilot, co-pilot, the group's assistant road-manager and three band members (Van Zant, Gaines, and Steve's older sister, backup singer\nCassie Gaines), and severely injuring most who survived the crash. The album performed well on the charts, peaking at #5 (their first top 5 album), as did the singles &quot;What's Your Name&quot; and &quot;That Smell&quot;, the former a top 20 hit on the singles chart.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.What's your name                                     [03:34]\n02.That smell                                           [05:48]\n03.One more time                                        [05:04]\n04.I know A little                                      [03:28]\n05.You got that right                                   [03:47]\n06.I never dreamed                                      [05:23]\n07.Honky tonk night time man                            [04:05]\n08.Ain't no good life                                   [04:42]\n____\n\n35:51 min\n 52,7 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e54eb5d8c00b18df6ededf32a76e0e4ac6db85a","amp;dn":"Lynyrd_Skynyrd-Street_Survivors-%28Retail%29-1977-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e54eb5d8c00b18df6ededf32a76e0e4ac6db85a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,84,235,93,140,0,177,141,246,237,237,243,42,118,224,228,172,109,184,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
