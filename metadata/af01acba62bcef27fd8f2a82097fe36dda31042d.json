One innocent woman. And one VICIOUS frickin' werewolf.\n\nMeet George and Lou, thugs for hire. The kind of intimidating-yet-friendly guys who will break your thumbs, but be polite about it.\n\nTheir latest assignment is to drive across Florida to deliver some precious cargo to a crime lord. The cargo: a man in a cage. Though Ivan seems perfectly human, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re warned that he is, in fact, a bloodthirsty werewolf.\n\nGeorge and Lou donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe in the supernatural, but even if they did, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daytime and tonight isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the full moon. Their instructions are straightforward: Do not open the cage. Do not reach into the cage. Do not throw anything into the cage. And they don't.\n\nUnfortunately, Ivan doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play by the usual werewolf rules, and the thugs find themselves suddenly responsible for a ferocious escaped beast. One who can transform at will. One who enjoys killing in human form as much as he enjoys killing as a monster.\n\nIf George and Lou want to save their careers, dozens of people, and their own lives, they need to recapture him. Because Ivan the werewolf is in the mood for a murder spreeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFrom Jeff Strand, the three-time Bram Stoker Award nominated author of PRESSURE, comes 75,000 words of action-packed, blood-soaked werewolf terror!\n\nepub,mobi and txt. hilarious first half. highly recommended if you wanna laugh your ass off.
