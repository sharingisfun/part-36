K's Choice stormed onto the US music scene with its breakthrough hit &quot;Not An Addict&quot; (which has been misunderstood and in actuality is an anti-drug song). The album is a top-notch &quot;alternative rock&quot; CD, starting with &quot;Not An Addict&quot;, but containing many more instant recognizable hooks like &quot;A Sound Only You Can Hear&quot;, &quot;Mr. Freeze&quot;, &quot;Paradise in Me&quot; and the show-stopper at all of K's Choice's concerts, the sing-along &quot;Something's Wrong&quot;. While K's Choice worked the US tour circuit hard, they never could really quite make it &quot;big&quot; in the US. Nevermind, this album marked the band at its top, and remains the Belgian band's pride and joy. Give it a listen, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewel case. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP (The Quality Music Project)!
