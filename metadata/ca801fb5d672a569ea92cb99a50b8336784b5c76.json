It's an indispensable tool for system administrators, developers and support engineers.\n\nThe system monitor displays process and thread creation as well as binary image loading. The device monitor allows you to capture communications between applications and device drivers.\n\nMultiMon offers three different types of file monitoring: File API monitoring which monitors file activity from the perspective of the application, file system monitoring which monitors file activity from the perspective of the file system and object monitoring which allows you to view activity on file objects from the perspective of the Windows object manager.\n\nThe registry monitor shows registry activity in real time.\n\nAs a bonus, MultiMon allows you to monitor clipboard, keyboard and task activities as well.\n\nMultiMon allows you to export output to text files and sort output views on columns. It offers a comprehensible non-destructive filter option. An optional 'merged view' allows you to display all activity in one single view.\n\nAll activities are recorded with lots of details, including a high-precision time stamp, process name and ID, thread ID, CPU ID, object handle, and window title.\n\nMultiMon runs on Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows 2003 Server SP2, Windows XP and Windows 2000 SP4, both x86 and x64 editions.
