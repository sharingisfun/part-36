The album's themes include personal isolation and nationalism.\r\n\r\nMuch of the album's improvised dialogue was originally recorded as part of sessions which produced We're Only in It for the Money and Uncle Meat, which contained some dialogue by the same speakers, and some of the dialogue on this album previously appeared on the re-edited version of Lumpy Gravy released in 1968. New dialogue was recorded by Zappa in 1991, and includes similarly improvised dialogue by members of the Ensemble Modern orchestra, Zappa's daughter Moon Unit and actor Michael Rapaport.\r\n\r\nCivilization Phaze III has been acclaimed as one of Zappa's best works, and has been appraised for its challenging, complex music, largely composed and performed on a Synclavier. \r\n\r\nZappa's masterpiece of electronic music, the genre's best-kept secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nCivilization Phaze III\r\n\r\n1994\r\n\r\n2012 Reissue\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2012 / VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\nDisc 1:\r\n\r\n1.
