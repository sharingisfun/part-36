Lofgren had formed the band with bassist Bob Gordon, and drummer Bob Berberich, in 1969 and the group played in the venues throughout the Washington, D.C. area. The band had a strong local fan base, releasing four critically acclaimed albums of catchy, hard rock, from 1971 to 1974, with guitar as Lofgren's primary instrument. Lofgren wrote the majority of the group's songs, and often shared vocal duties with other members of the band (primarily drummer Bob Berberich). After the second album Nils added brother Tom Lofgren as a rhythm guitarist. Grin failed to hit the big time, and were released by their record company.\n\n\n      &quot;1+1&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\n01.White Lies\n02.Please Don't Hide\n03.Slippery Fingers\n04.Moon Tears\n05.End Unkind\n06.Sometimes\n07.Lost a Number\n08.Hi, Hello Home\n09.Just a Poem\n10.Soft Fun\n\nAll tracks by Nils Lofgren\n\nPersonnel\n\nNils Lofgren - Guitars, Keyboards, Vocals\nBob Berberich - Drums, Vocals\nBob Gordon - Bass, Vocals\nGraham Nash - Vocals on &quot;Hi, Hello Home&quot;\nDavid Blumberg - Orchestration on &quot;Just a Poem&quot; &amp; &quot;Soft Fun&quot;\n\n      &quot;All Out&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\n11.Sad Letter\n12.Heavy Chevy\n13.Don't Be Long\n14.Love Again\n15.She Ain't Right\n16.Love or Else\n17.Ain't Love Nice\n18.Heart on Fire\n19.All Out\n20.Rusty Gun\n21.Just to Have You [*]\n\nPersonnel\n\nNils Lofgren - Guitars, Keyboards, Lead Vocals\nBob Berberich - Drums, Lead Vocals\nBob Gordon - Bass, Background Vocals\nTom Lofgren - Guitars, Background Vocals\n\nSpecial thanks to Kathy McDonald - Vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09c245117bd343c13ffceaa69917cbee11d930f8","amp;dn":"Nils+Lofgren+%26+Grin%3A+%5C%221%2B1%5C%22+%281971%29%2C+%5C%22All+Out%5C%22+%281972%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09c245117bd343c13ffceaa69917cbee11d930f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,194,69,17,123,211,67,193,63,252,234,166,153,23,203,238,17,217,48,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
