Among the poems in the collection are &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;, and in later editions, Whitman's elegy to the assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd&quot;. Whitman spent his entire life writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death.\n\nThis book is notable for its delight in and praise of the senses during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a2e1a13058db1deabf6faf49ccffd46149dcc03","amp;dn":"Leaves+of+grass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a2e1a13058db1deabf6faf49ccffd46149dcc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,46,26,19,5,141,177,222,171,246,250,244,156,207,253,70,20,157,204,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
