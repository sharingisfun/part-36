Fair play to TV3, as usual they are on the ball with their documentaries as this will investigate this mass grave in Galway where remains of almost 800 babies and children were found. The programme will examine the scandal, and introduces interviews with people who have been affected by it, along with their relatives and campaign groups fighting for justice.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 26-Jun-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c1d9e5719fd033633d5a74fe0fec1c8adee2552","amp;dn":"A.Secret.Buried.The.Mother.and.Baby.Scandal.PDTV.XviD-spinzes.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c1d9e5719fd033633d5a74fe0fec1c8adee2552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,29,158,87,25,253,3,54,51,213,167,79,224,254,193,200,173,238,37,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
