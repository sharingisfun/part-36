At the time of its release it was the longest Squeeze track ever issued, and it remains the only 7&quot; Squeeze single over six minutes long (the 12&quot; single version of &quot;Last Time Forever&quot;, released in 1985, exceeds &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot; in length by 11 seconds). It peaked at #51 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\nBacking vocals on &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot; were performed by Paul Young and Elvis Costello. \n\nSqueeze are a British band that came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the New Wave period of the late 1970s, and continued recording successfully in the 1980s and 1990s. They are known in the UK for their hit songs &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;Up the Junction&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Labelled With Love&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee In Bed&quot;, &quot;Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)&quot;, and &quot;Hourglass&quot;. Though not quite as commercially successful in the U.S., &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Hourglass&quot; and &quot;853-5937&quot; were all American chart hits for Squeeze, and the band have a dedicated following there and continue to attract new fans. All of Squeeze's hits were written by band members Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford. \n\nThe group formed in Deptford, London in 1975, and first broke up in 1982. Squeeze then reformed in 1985, and broke up again in 1999. The band reunited for tours through the United States and United Kingdom in 2007, and this touring version of Squeeze has continued into the present day. \n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2012, Difford and Tilbrook confirmed that they would be recording an album of new material for release in 2013. The band will be undertaking a full UK 'Pop Up Shop' Tour in November and December 2012. \n\nSqueeze announced on the Radcliffe and Maconie show on BBC Radio 6 that they would be selling live recordings of every night's show on the tour at each venue via a 'Pop up Shop'. They also debuted the first track 'Tommy' from their as yet untitled studio album. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Coffee_in_Bed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Coffee_in_Bed&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAFDBAAEm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAFDBAAEm&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 6000kbps\n   Audio1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 384kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:54\n\n\n*To change the audio tracks in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources*\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
