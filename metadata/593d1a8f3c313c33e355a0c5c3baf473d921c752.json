The Files are 160 Kbs .M4a, so the upload is pretty good quality. This album was made with a guitar directly plugged into the stock onboard audio aux input of my computer, FLStudio, EZdrummer, and various free VST's on the web.  This work represents 3 years of shoehorning recording time into a life full of children, full time employment and other necessary distraction.\n\nApsis is a concept album about a man, who after realizing that his home is being foreclosed upon and that his wife is leaving him, commits a heinous crime.  The guilt of this crime drives him to suicide by jumping off of a bridge.  He soon realizes that death is not the end.... and then shit gets really weird.\n\nHope you enjoy.  If you do, support me by buying the album.  If not, support another artist you do like.\n\nWise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593d1a8f3c313c33e355a0c5c3baf473d921c752","amp;dn":"Jovian+Litany+-+APSIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593d1a8f3c313c33e355a0c5c3baf473d921c752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,61,26,143,60,49,60,51,227,85,160,197,195,186,244,115,217,33,199,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
