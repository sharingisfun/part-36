But it does deliver 12 + 2 tough females ready to kick one's butt all over the Playstation. \n\nThe gameplay is set up somewhere between Street Fighter &amp; King Of Fighter styles. You can combo normal attacks by zig-zagging along the control pad. You can 2-in-1 your specials, supers (1 stock of energy), and ultras (2 stocks of energy). \n\nAnd despite what everybody says; they're right when they say it's a Street Fighter rip-off. But TGL pushes it to be the best darn SF rip-off ever known. \n\nThere are 12 &quot;waitresses&quot; to choose from: \n\nYuka, a Ryu-type character who's starting to question her own existence. Tamao, her Lillith-type &quot;fan.&quot; Satomi, their fire-weilding friend. Kaori, a computer geek who specializes in kicking. Chiho, a cute ninja. Kyoko, her serious-looking grappler associate Ayako, a dancer who never opens her eyes. Manami, some idol brat who fights like Blanka. Elli Lynn, a &quot;Playboy Bunny&quot; from America. Jun, a wrestler who would drain 50% of your life if you're not careful. Reimi, a boss who seems French. And Saki, an Iori Yagami rip-off. \n\nAnd the &quot;Story Mode&quot; has you as Tamao; fighting through her friends and rivals gaining her ultra move (some type of R-Type blast) and going head to head with the evil Miranda and her destructive &quot;experiment.&quot; \n\n&quot;Why an 8? Why not give it a 10?&quot; Well, because of the character's lips not matching the dialogue. &quot;IS THAT ALL?!&quot; Well, if you can gun through the insane dialoge-lip match, then Advanced VG 2 could be the game for you!\n\n\nReviewer's Score: 8/10 | Originally Posted: 11/01/99, Updated 11/01/99\n\nGenre: Fighting\nPublisher: TGL\nDeveloper: TGL\n\n\nGame Details\nMedia: 1 x CD-R\nRegion: NTSC-J\nESBR Rating: Everyone\nLanguages: Japanese\nPlayers: 1-2\nGame Altered: No\nOther Info: SLPM_87226\n\nFile Details\nFormat: .ecm (need to unpack for .bin/.cue)\nUnpacked size: 586 MB (614.876.267 bytes)\nTested and working with epsxe 1.9.0 \n\nInstructions\n1.
