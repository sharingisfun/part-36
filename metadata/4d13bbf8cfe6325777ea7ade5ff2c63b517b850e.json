I hope I didn't insult anyone about slighting the issues that followed Kurt Cobain's death. I have a friend who knows all the details that followed his death. For me it just really hurt when he died. It was like some of the color went out of the world. I don't think music is the same these days. For me when I was around in the 80's the music I listened to kind of defined. I don't see that much in music these days. I see it in the Foo Fighters and in Courtney Love and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and few others. I wrote a line once that in the 60's rock defied the past. And in the drug music of 70's rock forgot the past. In the 80's Punk denied the future. And now...we have become that future.\nI am going to post one last song and then I will wait until I can get my guitar and piano decent again. I was hurt so badly as a child. And it is so difficult to get these things back.
