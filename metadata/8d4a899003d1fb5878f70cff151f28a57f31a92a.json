ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one thing you can do: Run!\n\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve collected while running to build and grow your base.\n\nBBC NEWS - Ã¢â‚¬Å“The only way to save yourself is to run for real.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nWIRED - Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nLIFEHACKER - Ã¢â‚¬Å“A really cool way to get outside and exercise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nCNN - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nNPR - &quot;It gets you moving!&quot;\nTIME.COM - &quot;Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.&quot;\n\nWHAT PLAYERS SAY:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Evaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This game will make you sweat.
