Shot, cut, and proudced by TBMChicago's Eric VKX, the songs were all captured during one of the many performances he attended while helping promote the nation wide tour. After shelving the footage for an entire year, it was finally edited during the corse of a single week. Marathon editing sessions where made in an effort to complete the DVD in time to give the final copy to the band at their last show of the 2007 tour.\n\nOnly twenty-five copies were made, under the agreement that only the band, Eric, and their mutual friends would recieve them. A YouTube video showing a bit of the process and final product was posted shortly after. An incredible amount of interest in the &quot;Making of&quot; video eventually prompted an agreement to release the entire DVD online.\n\nContents include:\nReadMe\nTBM 2006 Bootleg DVD.img\nTBM 2006 Bootleg DVD - Cover.pdf\nTBM 2006 Bootleg DVD - Cover (Front)\nTBM 2006 Bootleg DVD - Cover (Back)\nTBM 2006 Bootleg DVD - The Making of.mp4\n\nTracklist: \n01.
