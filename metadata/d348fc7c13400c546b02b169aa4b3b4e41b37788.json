I got the torrent deleted as soon as I could, but sorry to those that got a an incomplete issue. Please delete it and get this one. I checked and triple checked to make sure all the pages are here. I read it and it flows.\n\nThe series finale is tonight so get a refresher on what's happened over the course of the series. This is a 20-page comic that focuses on all the broad strokes. It's also well drawn and written.\n\nI got this from AMC's web site: http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/all-bad-things\n\nIt's a pain to navigate through so I got all the images and turned them into a cbr. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d348fc7c13400c546b02b169aa4b3b4e41b37788","amp;dn":"Breaking+Bad+All+Bad+Things+%28Season+1-5+recap%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d348fc7c13400c546b02b169aa4b3b4e41b37788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,72,252,124,19,64,12,84,107,2,177,105,170,75,59,78,65,179,119,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
