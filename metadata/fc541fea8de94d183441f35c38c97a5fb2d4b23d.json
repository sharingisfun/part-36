Right they hail from Corby and have been together since 2008 and this new release has been produced by the legend that is Mr Chris (Dark Lord) Tsangrides. \nBlack Acid Souls are: Flakey - Vocals, Chubbs - Guitar, Gruff - Bass, Hoff - Drums, Zed - Guitar Pain - A haunting PianoÃ¢â‚¬â€œ A haunting Piano and choral intro lead us into a sustained guitar. We are talking old school horror film scores with a slight hint of gothic malevolence.\n Kick in the drums and you build to your first listen of Flakeys vocals. \nFirst you may be surprised by the vocals, it's mid range with a twist and very distict, go with it! Pain is a great opener that makes you wonder what the rest of the album will deliver. \nBitter Taste Sweet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This is rocker from the off, solid riffage and a good bouncing drum sound. \nYou'll be able to hear some of the sounds that have influenced the band. \nFrom Thrash right through to Southern Rock. \nBTS is a solid slab of neck aching metal. The guitar work is as you'd expect. So far so good then\n\nAcid Souls - Shadow Walker (2015)\nHard Rock  Heavy Metal\n \nBlack Acid Souls - Shadow Walker (2015)\nDate: 24 July 2015\n\n    ARTIST: Black Acid Souls\n    Ãƒï¿½LBUM : Shadow Walker\n    Year: 2015\n    Country: UK\n    Genre: Hard Rock, Heavy Metal\n    Time:\t00:51:07\n    FORMAT: MP3\n    : 320 kbps\n    \tblackacidsouls.com\n\n   \n\n\nDescripciÃƒÂ³n\n\n01.
