Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons, it is a deception to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader. Also suspicious of Poundsgate is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne, who lets slip to Miller that Poundsgate told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi, code-named Magellan, who told him about the weapons, though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the contrary. So begins a hunt for the truth. Who's playing whom?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226ab588c418bfef568c7723743a7b7f60f3343d","amp;dn":"Green+Zone+2010+-+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226ab588c418bfef568c7723743a7b7f60f3343d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,106,181,136,196,24,191,239,86,140,119,35,116,58,123,127,96,243,52,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
