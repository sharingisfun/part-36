So, here goes.\n\nI drastically shortened and systematized the filenames, which now consist of four snippets (or &quot;tokens&quot;, if you're into programmerese), separated by underscores.\n\n[...]   7739852_2012.10.10_HL.03.R1_I-N.torrent\n        7740406_2012.09.00_0D.01.R2_A-V.torrent   [...]\n\nFirst snippet: TPB identifier of the torrent. I put this on the left to get them in chronological order, plus you can use it to construct the upload page URL directly.\n\nSecond snippet: Date (whodathunk) given in torrent name. Ordinary dates always refer to Weeklies, while dates with a &quot;00&quot; in the day position always refer to monthlies.\n\nThird snippet: Type of torrent. In order, 0D(ay) or H(it)L(ist), part number, and\nrevision (1 for the regulars, 2 for &quot;fixes&quot;, &quot;repacks&quot;, &quot;fillers&quot;, and so forth).\n\nFourth snippet: Initial letters of first and last files contained. Occasionally meaningless when torrent wasn't alphabetized, but quite useful otherwise, I'd say.\n\nAny mistakes made in the original titles are preserved here, incidentally, so trust the first and last tokens rather than the ones in the middle, whenever in doubt. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab0b7499951fbc16ce6a526c618290ce955aeb77","amp;dn":"0-Days+%2B+Hitlists+torrentable+%282012-04+-+2013-12%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab0b7499951fbc16ce6a526c618290ce955aeb77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,11,116,153,149,31,188,22,206,106,82,108,97,130,144,206,149,90,235,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
