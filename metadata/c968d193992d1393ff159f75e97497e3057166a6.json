A phenomenally successful instrumentalist whose recordings make the pop charts, Kenny G's sound has been a staple on adult contemporary and smooth jazz radio stations since the mid-'80s, making him a household name. Kenny G is a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of &quot;contemporary jazz&quot; charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t21760-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.82% CDDA &amp; 99.75% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Songbird\n02.The Moment\n03.Silhouette\n04.Havana\n05.Sax-O-Loco\n06.Yesterday\n07.Forever In Love\n08.Love Theme (From 'Romeo And Juliet')\n09.Summertime\n10.Brazil\n11.Sabor A Mi\n12.Paradise\n13.My Heart Will Go On (From 'Titanic')\n14.Loving You\n15.Waiting For You\n16.Going Home\n17.Alone\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.What A Wonderful World\n02.Besame Mucho\n03.The Shadow Of Your Smile\n04.The Look Of Love\n05.You're Beautiful\n06.The Girl From Ipanema\n07.Mirame Bailar (Feat.
