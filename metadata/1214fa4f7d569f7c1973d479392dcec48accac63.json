The fans loved him and so did the sportswriters who delighted in asking the usual baseball questions, only to get philosophical responses involving the relationship between Camus and the curveball or the effects of karma on a pitcher's rotator cuff. Blacklisted from professional baseball in 1983, Lee was left to roam the world in search of a chance to play the game he loves. The film follows Lee, approaching sixty years young, on a road trip from his farm in Vermont to the impoverished baseball mecca of Cuba and his triumphant return to Fenway Park","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1214fa4f7d569f7c1973d479392dcec48accac63","amp;dn":"Spaceman+-+A+Baseball+Odyssey+%282006%29+DVDRip+x264+AC3+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1214fa4f7d569f7c1973d479392dcec48accac63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,20,250,79,125,86,159,124,25,115,212,121,57,45,206,196,138,204,172,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
