I've got all the vinyl LPs (worn out and scratched) but this 2CD collection hits all the high notes. A =GREAT= rock'n'roll band with the blistering-fast fingers of Alvin Lee on guitar, this is a must-have for all rock'n'roll fans.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Years_After&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Years_After&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-anthology-1967-1971-hip-o-mw0000220713&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-anthology-1967-1971-hip-o-mw0000220713&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1-01 I Want to Know\n1-02 I Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes\n1-03 Spoonful\n1-04 Help Me\n1-05 Portable People\n1-06 The Sounds\n1-07 Rock Your Mama\n1-08 Spider in My Web\n1-09 I May Be Wrong, but I Won't Be Wrong Always (live)\n1-10 Going to Try\n1-11 Woman Trouble\n1-12 Hear Me Calling\n1-13 Boogie On\n2-01 I Woke Up This Morning\n2-02 If You Should Love Me\n2-03 Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\n2-04 I'm Going Home (live at Woodstock)\n2-05 Me and My Baby\n2-06 Love Like a Man\n2-07 50,000 Miles Beneath My Brain\n2-08 I'm Coming On\n2-09 My Baby Left Me\n2-10 One of These Days\n2-11 Here They Come\n2-12 I'd Love to Change the World\n2-13 Let the Sky Fall\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08a17fb45cfa72202e10b528ddebe4a13014587b","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+The+Anthology+1967-1971+%282002%2C+2CD%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08a17fb45cfa72202e10b528ddebe4a13014587b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,161,127,180,92,250,114,32,46,16,181,40,221,235,228,161,48,20,88,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
