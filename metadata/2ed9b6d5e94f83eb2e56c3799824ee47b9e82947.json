It contends that this element is omitted from art and design theory as a product of the division of labour and alienation as it operates within the realms of theory and art history. \n\nIt investigates the &quot;beauty&quot; of art based on the somatic &quot;magic&quot; of the physical body and its relationship to nature, arguing that the sensual affect of expert artistic combinations of art materials in some paintings exploits a bridge between the intricacies of human sentience and the external world. Art is thus more accurately located next to the sciences of language, mathematics, physiology and psychoanalysis. As the &quot;pure mathematics&quot; of the discipline, this materialist definition of fine-art develops guidelines for architecture, design, cultural-studies and ultimately social change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ed9b6d5e94f83eb2e56c3799824ee47b9e82947","amp;dn":"Color%2C+Facture%2C+Art+and+Design+-+Artistic+Technique+and+the+Prec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ed9b6d5e94f83eb2e56c3799824ee47b9e82947","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,217,182,213,233,79,131,235,46,86,195,121,152,36,238,71,185,232,41,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
