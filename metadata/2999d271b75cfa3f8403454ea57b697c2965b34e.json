This is my first torrent, so be patient if I screw it up the first time! A big thanks to everyone who has uploaded other languages! \n\nI only have level 1 and probably won't get level 2 until October. If someone has it already, it would be appreciated if you'd post it. This works with version 3.2 and I've not tested it with the 3.5 app.\n\nFor new users of Rosetta - This does NOT include the Rosetta Stone application!! There is no setup or install program in this ISO. There have been several posts and tutorials on where to find the application and how to install languages.\n\nThanks!\nBrewHaHa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2999d271b75cfa3f8403454ea57b697c2965b34e","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+Irish+V3+Level+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2999d271b75cfa3f8403454ea57b697c2965b34e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,153,210,113,183,92,250,63,132,3,69,78,165,123,105,124,41,101,179,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
