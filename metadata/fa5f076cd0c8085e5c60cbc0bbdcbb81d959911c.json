The novel is one of the sprightliest of the season and will add to the author's reputation as an inventor of 'queer' plots.&quot; \n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nMary Roberts Rinehart (August 12, 1876 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ September 22, 1958) was an American writer, often called the American Agatha Christie,[1] although her first mystery novel was published 14 years before Christie's first novel in 1922.[2]\n\nRinehart is considered the source of the phrase &quot;The butler did it&quot; from her novel The Door (1930), although the novel does not use the exact phrase. Rinehart is also considered to have invented the &quot;Had-I-But-Known&quot; school of mystery writing, with the publication of The Circular Staircase (1908).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa5f076cd0c8085e5c60cbc0bbdcbb81d959911c","amp;dn":"+The+After+House%7CEPUB%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa5f076cd0c8085e5c60cbc0bbdcbb81d959911c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,95,7,108,208,200,8,94,92,96,203,192,187,220,187,129,217,89,145,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
