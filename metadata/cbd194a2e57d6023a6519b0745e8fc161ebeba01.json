It finished its main line career as recently as May 2007 as number 47860 \n\nand is fitted with long range fuel tanks having worked long range passenger \n\nservices for most of its life. \n\nClass 03 D2133 is today used on the West Somerset Railway for similar shunting \n\nduties around Minehead yard, moving stock and locomotives, and forming trains on \n\na daily basis. The locomotive was originally allocated to Taunton during its \n\nmainline life, and has the distinction of never leaving Somerset in its lifetime. \n\nBoth locomotives are available in their 1960s BR liveries, the Class 47 in two-\n\ntone green paint scheme and the Class 03 in green livery with yellow ends. \n\nIncluded are BR Mk1 coaches as seen on the railway and assorted two-axle freight \n\nwagons. \n\nThe locomotives are also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive \n\nthe BR Class 47 and BR Class 03 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train \n\nSimulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the West Somerset Railway \n\nroute (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nPlease use the email address or the facebook fanpage for requests, questions and \n\nalso if you want to share an addon with the community which we will post on your \n\nbehalf.\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please read the Readme.pdf.\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;dca8b9bdb1a8acbee8b9aab9ae9cbbb1bdb5b0f2bfb3b1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd194a2e57d6023a6519b0745e8fc161ebeba01","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+WSR+Diesels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd194a2e57d6023a6519b0745e8fc161ebeba01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,209,148,162,229,125,96,35,166,81,155,7,69,232,252,22,30,190,186,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
