The song was composed by Gordie Sampson, Steven McEwan and Hillary Lindsey. A video has been filmed for the song. The video has been released as of August 5, 2008. The song was officially released to radio on July 21, 2008.\n\nThe music video begins with Underwood sitting with her military love in an Chevy Nova Convertible, both listening to Eddy Arnold&amp;#039;s &quot;Make the World Go Away&quot;, and trying not to talk about the inevitability of him leaving for war. As she imagines what it would be like to walk down the aisle to marry her sweetheart, UnderwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s smile and white dress transform into a black mourning dress and tears as she walks down the aisle to her fiance&amp;#039;s coffin. The video is made to look like around the time of the Vietnam War. \n\nFor the week of November 8, 2008, the song has become Underwood&amp;#039;s sixth consecutive Number One single, as well as her seventh overall, tying Underwood with Rosanne Cash and Shania Twain for the most Number Ones for a female artist from the one album. Also it had sold 309,000 copies \n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7073545715053e12469759a5b8d2a451546ac5","amp;dn":"Carrie+Underwood+-+Just+A+Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7073545715053e12469759a5b8d2a451546ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,112,115,84,87,21,5,62,18,70,151,89,165,184,210,164,81,84,106,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
