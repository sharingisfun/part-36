It was originally released in 2003 by Instant Karma sublabel Dharma Records during &quot;a period of transition for the band's label&quot;[1]. It was recorded in the home studio of band member Dean Honer. Capitalization of the final letter in the album's name is suggested by the typography of the original cover art, but recognition of this has been inconsistent in the press. The title is a palindrome. &quot;The Blue Wrath&quot; was used in the 2004 British comedy Shaun of the Dead and appeared on the movie's soundtrack. The I Monster version of &quot;Daydream in Blue&quot; was used as theme music for the 2002 French action movie Steal and appeared in 2006 television commercials for the Ford Focus.\nContents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc63d3868e0072d2e5bd2755d6a43bb16186dc4b","amp;dn":"I+Monster+Neveroddoreven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc63d3868e0072d2e5bd2755d6a43bb16186dc4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,99,211,134,142,0,114,210,229,189,39,85,214,164,59,177,97,134,220,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
