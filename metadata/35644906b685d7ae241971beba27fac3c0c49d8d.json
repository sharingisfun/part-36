The first artist signed to David Geffen's Asylum label, she released two albums, then worked briefly as a cartoonist before dying of drug abuse in 1979. Her eponymous debut album was released in late 1971 and was followed around eighteen months later by Heart Food. She also recorded demos for a third album in 1974, which were released with other rarities on the 2005 two-disc collection Dreams Come True.\nSill was heavily influenced by Bach's metric forms and suites, while lyrically her work drew substantially on Christian themes of rapture and redemption.\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35644906b685d7ae241971beba27fac3c0c49d8d","amp;dn":"Judee+Sill-2+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35644906b685d7ae241971beba27fac3c0c49d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,100,73,6,182,133,215,174,36,25,113,190,186,39,250,195,192,196,157,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
