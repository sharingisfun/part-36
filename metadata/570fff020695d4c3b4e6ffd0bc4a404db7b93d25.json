I had thought that most work of this sort was becoming relegated to either ambient music or film scores composed by people who still think Bernard Herrman is the epitome of his craft and therefore &quot;the shit.&quot; Thankfully Midnight Syndicate has proven me wrong on all counts. The music on their new CD, &quot;Born of the Night,&quot; is everything one could ask for in a late night listening disc; strong melodies, orchestration that is subtle yet sumptuous, and an overall sense that the collective vision behind it is both coherent and cohesive. &quot;Born of the Night&quot; is music that sounds as if it could be a lost film score from a classic Hammer film . . . only with a more electronic edge.

This gothic soundtrack contains chilling sound effects, haunting melodies, and pulse-pounding orchestrations to set the mood for your darkest nightmare. Venture forth...if you dare.&quot; \n\nAlthough the multimedia concerts supporting their self-titled 1997 debut received much critical acclaim, it was this collaboration with gothic-fantasy artist Joseph Vargo (&quot;Born of the Night&quot;)that garnered Midnight Syndicate an underground following throughout the United States and abroad.\n\n    \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570fff020695d4c3b4e6ffd0bc4a404db7b93d25","amp;dn":"Midnight+Syndicate+-+Born+of+The+Night+%281998%29+%7B192+kbs%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570fff020695d4c3b4e6ffd0bc4a404db7b93d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,15,255,2,6,149,212,195,180,230,255,208,188,74,64,77,183,185,61,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
