Its contents span most of the length of his career up to the time of its release, starting in 1956 with his first hit record, &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, and ending with &quot;Unity, Pt. 1&quot;, his 1984 collaboration with Afrika Bambaataa. It includes a few previously unreleased tracks. The box set's title comes from the question Brown's announcer would ask audiences at the start of Brown's concerts: &quot;Are you ready for star time?&quot; Star Time's liner notes, written by Cliff White, Harry Weinger, Nelson George, Alan Leeds and Brown himself, won a 1991 Grammy Award for Best Album Notes. The notes also include album and singles discographies and a one-page comic by Mary Fleener, a visual interpretation of the song &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good).&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked number 79 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Don Harrison - It would seem impossible to summarize James Brown's contribution to R&amp;B--to American music--in a mere four compact discs, but somehow Star Time does it. This boxed set charts Brown's early rise as a hard-hitting R&amp;B-styled vocalist (&quot;Please Please Please,&quot; &quot;Try Me&quot;) and shows how his bandleading skills (one can't forget inventive players like saxophonist Maceo Parker, bassist Bootsy Collins, drummer Jabo Starks, and many others) changed the face of soul and invented funk in the '60s and early '70s with impeccably timed (&quot;Papa's Got a Brand New Bag&quot;), highly rhythmic (&quot;I Can't Stand It&quot;), primal (&quot;Licking Stick Licking Stick&quot;) hits. The box also does a definitive programming job on Brown's more spotty later years--another plus. This is where beginners should start, but several extended versions and rarities (like &quot;Papa,&quot; raised an octave on original release, at normal speed) make it a must for completists too.\n\nDisc 01 \n\n[01] Please, Please, Please\n[02] Why Do You Do Me?\n[03] Try Me\n[04] Tell Me What I Did Wrong\n[05] Bewildered\n[06] Good Good Lovin'\n[07] I'll Go Crazy\n[08] I Know It's True\n[09] (Do The) Mashed Potatoes, Pt. 1\n[10] Think\n[11] Baby You're Right\n[12] Lost Someone\n[13] Night Train\n[14] I've Got Money\n[15] I Don't Mind\n[16] Prisoner Of Love\n[17] Devil's Den\n[18] Out Of The Blue\n[19] Out Of Sight\n[20] Grits\n[21] Maybe The Last Time\n[22] It's A Man's World\n[23] I Got You\n[24] Papa's Got A Brand New Bag, Pts. 1, 2 &amp; 3\n\n\tDisc 01 Play Time 01h:11m:26s\n\nDisc 02 \n\n[01] Papa's Got A Brand New Bag, Pt. 1\n[02] I Got You (I Feel Good)\n[03] Ain't That A Groove\n[04] It's A Man's Man's Man's World\n[05] Money Won't Change You\n[06] Don't Be A Dropout\n[07] Bring It Up (Hipster's Avenue)\n[08] Let Yourself Go\n[09] Cold Sweat\n[10] Get It Together\n[11] I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me), Pt. 1\n[12] I Got The Feelin'\n[13] Licking Stick-Licking Stick\n[14] Say It Loud, I'm Black And I'm Proud, Pt .1\n[15] There Was A Time\n[16] Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\n[17] I Don't Want Nobody To Give Me Nothimg (Open Up The Door I'll Get It Myself)\n\n\tDisc 02 Play Time 01h:14m:27s\n\nDisc 03 \n\n[01] Mother Popcorn\n[02] Funky Drummer\n[03] Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine\n[04] Super Bad\n[05] Talkin' Loud &amp; Sayin' Nothing\n[06] Get Up, Get Into It And Get Involved\n[07] Soul Power\n[08] Brother Rapp / Ain't It Funky Now (Live)\n[09] Hot Pants\n[10] I'm A Greedy Man\n[11] Make It Funky\n[12] It's A New Day (Live)\n[13] I Got Ants In My Pants\n[14] King Heroin\n\n\tDisc 03 Play Time 01h:12m:48s\n\nDisc 04 \n\n[01] There It Is\n[02] Public Enemy #1\n[03] Get On The Good Foot\n[04] I Got A Bag Of My Own\n[05] Doing It To Death\n[06] The Payback\n[07] Papa Don't Take No Mess\n[08] Stone To The Bone\n[09] My Thang\n[10] Funky President (People It's Bad)\n[11] Hot (I Need To Be Loved, Loved, Loved)\n[12] Get Up Offa That Thing (Release The Pressure)\n[13] Body Heat\n[14] It's Too Funky In Here\n[15] Rapp Payback (Where Iz Moses)\n[16] Unity: The Third Coming\n\n\tDisc 04 Play Time 01h:15m:30s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 04h:54m:11s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 1.71GBs (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta - FLAC\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Soul Gospel\nRelease Date\t&gt; 07 May 1991\nRecord Company\t&gt; Polydor\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.jamesbrown.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown\n&gt; http://lyrics.wikia.com/James_Brown\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44e0596dc8daff38300d9b50bc235bc8c68d0a70","amp;dn":"%5B1991%5D+Star+Time+%28Boxset%29+-+James+Brown+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44e0596dc8daff38300d9b50bc235bc8c68d0a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,224,89,109,200,218,255,56,48,13,155,80,188,35,91,200,198,141,10,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
