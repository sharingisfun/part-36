John was the part of the puzzle that was missing all these yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ His unique style, sound, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“freshÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ approach, got the best out of A\nlex and Tas. After lots of live performances and a year later they hit the studio and record 11 songs that signal the birth of Ã¢â‚¬Å“PHASE REVERSEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½...\nBlues, Rock' N' Roll, Hard Rock, and Heavy Metal all sonically mix while the American Southern Rock is set as a background all processed in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“PHASE REVERSEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mode resulting in the particular\nand simultaneously modern sound of the band.\nThey called it ''Heavy Rock'' and this was something new for the Greek Rock and Metal scene in 2007.\nOne thing is for sure, that we are dealing with some genuine rockers that their songs simply and genuinely declare their presence in their own unique way with a voice of their own at a time that is characterized by labelsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ in their own words:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦our music is just RockÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Heavy Rock!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ‚Â· Ã¢â‚¬Å“Phase ReverseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ released their Debut CD on 07 Dec 2009 available on the Greek market only\nand digitally at: Amazon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ e Music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ iTunes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Napster &amp; Rapsody.\n\nIf you like this,support the band,buy the cd.Also seed it as much\nyou can.Cheers/horns up and many thanks to the original uploader!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64661b1ead3250398c84d89fc6aec64f5e793a23","amp;dn":"Phase+Reverse+-+Phase+Reverse+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64661b1ead3250398c84d89fc6aec64f5e793a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,102,27,30,173,50,80,57,140,132,216,159,198,174,198,79,94,121,58,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
