The titular female, played by Gerda Maurus (one of the stars of Lang's 1928 classic Spies) joins an extraterrestrial expedition in search of gold on the moon. Among the many prescient aspects of the film is its use of a countdown before blast-off and its depiction of the effects of centrifugal force upon the lunar passengers. Willy Ley, later a leading light of the U.S. space program, served as technical adviser. \n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Frau Im Mond.1929.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 143 Kbps\nLength            : 8.48 GiB for 2h 49mn 55s 685ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : de\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019901/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019901/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Silent, with German intertitles\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip of MoC Blu-Ray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a17a58f525ecaa9107a0c370e3bfc8f224ea79","amp;dn":"Frau+Im+Mond.1929.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a17a58f525ecaa9107a0c370e3bfc8f224ea79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,161,122,88,245,37,236,170,145,7,160,195,112,227,191,200,242,36,234,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
