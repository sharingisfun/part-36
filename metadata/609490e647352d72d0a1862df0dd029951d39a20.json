This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne artist in the countdown says appearing on the cover of Time magazine nearly ruined him. Casey tells the story.\n\nCasey calls two of these songs, &quot;Space Rock.&quot;\n\nLinda Ronstadt has two songs in the countdown.\n\n&quot;You Make Lovin Fun&quot; by Fleetwood Mac moves up 13 places. It is from their hit album &quot;Rumors&quot; which is spending its 27th week at number one.\n\nCasey tells of how Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) almost couldn't take a role in Star Wars because he was under contract to act in &quot;Eight Is Enough.&quot;\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which song in the 70s so far has stayed at number one the longest?&quot;\n\nOne artist in the countdown is the only person in chart history to hit number one, while having a parent AND a grandparent who have also hit number one.\n\n40:    Swingtown Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Steve Miller Band\n39:    Signed, Sealed, And Delivered Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Frampton\n38:    Thunder In My Heart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Leo Sayer        \n37:    Here You Come Again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dolly Parton     \n36:    Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Carpenters     \n35:    Back In Love Again - Ltd    \n34:    Gone Too Far Ã¢â‚¬â€œ England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n33:    The King Is Gone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ronnie McDowell\n32:    Your Smiling Face Ã¢â‚¬â€œ James Taylor\n31:    I Go Crazy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Davis\n30:    Slip SlidinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Simon\n29:    My Fair Share Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Seals &amp; Crofts\nExtra: Mr. Bo Jangles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band    \n28:    She Did It Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eric Carmen\n27:    Keep It CominÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n26:    Come Sail Away - Styx\n25:    IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t It Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Babys\n24:    Daybreak (Live) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barry Manilow\n23:    Send In The Clowns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Judy Collins\n22:    ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Easy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Linda Ronstadt\n21:    Cold As Ice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Foreigner\n20:    We Just Disagree Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dave Mason\n19:    Dusic - Brick\n18:    Do You Wanna Get Funky With Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Brown\n17:    You Make LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Fun Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fleetwood Mac\n16:    Help Is On Its Way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Little River Band\n15:    Star Wars Title Theme - Meco\n14:    Brick House Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores\n13:    ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shaun Cassidy\n12:    Just Remember I Love You - Firefall\n11:    Blue Bayou Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Linda Ronstadt\n10:    WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re All Alone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rita Coolidge\n9:    How Deep Is Your Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Bee Gees\n8:    Heaven On The 7th Floor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Nicholas\n7:    Baby, What A Big Surprise - Chicago\n6:    I Feel Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donna Summer\n5:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Crystal Gayle\n4:    ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barry White\n3:    Nobody Does It Better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Carly Simon\n2:    Boogie Nights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Heat Wave\n1:    You Light Up My Life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Debby Boone\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:609490e647352d72d0a1862df0dd029951d39a20","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_November_12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"609490e647352d72d0a1862df0dd029951d39a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,148,144,230,71,53,45,114,208,161,134,45,240,221,2,153,81,211,154,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
