Hours before, the shogunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢'s cousin, Saburo, was stabbed to death in the shogunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s palace. The murder weapon: KazuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal dagger. Kazu says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocent, and begs for HiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, but his story gives Hiro reason to doubt the young shinobiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s claims.\n\nWhen the shogun summons Hiro and Father Mateo, the Portuguese Jesuit priest under HiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protection, to find the killer, Hiro finds himself forced to choose between friendship and personal honor.\n\nThe investigation reveals a plot to assassinate the shogun and overthrow the ruling Ashikaga clan. With Lord OdaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemy forces approaching Kyoto, and the murderer poised to strike again, Hiro must use his assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills to reveal the killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity and protect the shogun at any cost. Kazu, now trapped in the city, still refuses to explain his whereabouts at the time of the murder. \n\nBut a suspicious shogunate maid, SaburoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, and the shogunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stable master also had reasons to want Saburo dead. With the shogun demanding the murdererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head before Lord Oda reaches the city, Hiro and Father Mateo must produce the killer in time ... or die in his place.\n\nSusan Spann's Blade of the Samurai is a complex mystery that will transport readers to a thrilling and unforgettable adventure in sixteenth-century Japan.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53121fd80e041feb8526f77cfb8abbec1dffe0af","amp;dn":"Blade+of+the+Samurai+by+Susan+Spann+%28Shinobi+Mystery+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53121fd80e041feb8526f77cfb8abbec1dffe0af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,18,31,216,14,4,31,235,133,38,247,124,251,138,187,236,29,255,224,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
