So he sends \n two of his staff, Osamu Sakurai and Kinsaburo Furue, to Pharoh Island to bring back some berries, called soma, noted for their \n non-addictive narcotic effect. He also wants the two to bring back proof of a giant ape named King Kong. As this is going on, a submarine \n collides with an iceberg releasing Godzilla, who was trapped there seven years earlier. When Osamu and Kinsaburo arrive at Pharoh, they \n not only find the berries but the giant ape. After a battle with a giant octopus, Kong drinks the juice that is made from the berries and \n falls asleep. While he is sleeping, the pair tie him to a raft and take him back to Japan. In the meantime, Godzilla is rampaging \n throughout the Japanese countryside. While in route to Japan, Kong breaks free and swims toward Japan and inevitably on a collision course \n with Godzilla.\n\nSize: 634 mb\nres: 640x480\n29 f/sec\nData: 900 kbps\nBit: 964 kbps\nColor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd1de6116698fb0911b7acdb90a72a10af0b9e53","amp;dn":"King+Kong+vs.+Godzilla+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd1de6116698fb0911b7acdb90a72a10af0b9e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,29,230,17,102,152,251,9,17,183,172,219,144,167,42,16,175,11,158,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
