They abandoned the modal, polyrhythmic approach in favor of the two-guitars/4/4 pop structures ...    Full Descriptionof yore. While LITTLE CREATURES is the band's most accessible, radio-friendly album, it's not a step backwards by any means, because as they return to the quirky &quot;new wave&quot; style that made them famous, they bring a well-earned sophistication (both harmonic and lyrical) to the table. These advances allow the band to knock out a crop of winners, like the anti-anthem &quot;Road To Nowhere,&quot; the semi-mystical (but still damn catchy) &quot;And She Was&quot; and the we've-got-a-baby-now, let's-party-with-him rocker &quot;Stay Up Late.&quot; Nothing here is as groundbreaking as BUILDINGS AND FOOD, but it's still the Talking Heads, full of idiosyncratic charm and smart-but-infectious tunes.\n\nRecorded at Sigma Sound, New York, New York.\n\nTalking Heads: David Byrne (guitar, vocals); Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar, background vocals); Tina Weymouth (bass, background vocals); Chris Frantz (drums).\n\n 1.
