In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1721ea57fce1decd34063a2686b00abc122375","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Tsivo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1721ea57fce1decd34063a2686b00abc122375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,23,33,234,87,252,225,222,205,52,6,58,38,134,176,10,188,18,35,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
