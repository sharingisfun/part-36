The album began life as a Brad Roberts solo project. While the lyrics were written by Brad Roberts, most of the music was written by Stuart Cameron. Perhaps not coincidentally, this album is, musically-speaking, more conventional, less original. Ellen sang backing vocals and Dan played bass, though much of the music was performed by other musicians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc10d5b74837f30c5dc5db4ef4cfd1edde500c81","amp;dn":"Crash+Test+Dummies-Puss+N+Boots+2003%2Fmp3%2F192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc10d5b74837f30c5dc5db4ef4cfd1edde500c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,16,213,183,72,55,243,12,93,197,219,78,244,207,209,237,222,80,12,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
