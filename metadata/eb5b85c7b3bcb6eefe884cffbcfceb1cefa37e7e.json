This was the first album to earn an RIAA platinum award. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is the 31st best-selling album in the world, selling more than 25 million copies.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tWith its endless, droning minor-key riff and mumbled vocals, &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; is arguably the most notorious song of the acid rock era. According to legend, the group was so stoned when they recorded the track that they could neither pronounce the title &quot;In the Garden of Eden&quot; or end the track, so it rambles on for a full 17 minutes, which to some listeners sounds like eternity. But that's the essence of its appeal -- it's the epitome of heavy psychedelic excess, encapsulating the most indulgent tendencies of the era. Iron Butterfly never matched the warped excesses of &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,&quot; either on their debut album of the same name or the rest of their catalog, yet they occasionally made some enjoyable fuzz guitar-driven psychedelia that works as a period piece. The five tracks that share space with their magnum opus on In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida qualify as good artifacts, and the entire record still stands as the group's definitive album, especially since this is the only place the full-length title track is available. ~ by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Allmusic GuideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Most Anything You Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n2. &quot;Flowers And Beads&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n3. &quot;My Mirage&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n4. &quot;Termination&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n5. &quot;Are You Happy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n6. &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 17:07\n\n* Doug Ingle: Organ, keyboards, clavinet, piano, vocals\n* Erik Brann: Guitars, violin, vocals\n* Lee Dorman: Bass guitar\n* Ron Bushy: Drums, percussion\n\n\n\n\n\nMANY THX TO THE ORIGINAL RELEASER\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb5b85c7b3bcb6eefe884cffbcfceb1cefa37e7e","amp;dn":"Iron+Butterfly+-+In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida%281968%29%282006+Japan+Rem.%29%5BEAC-A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb5b85c7b3bcb6eefe884cffbcfceb1cefa37e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,91,133,199,179,188,182,238,254,136,76,255,188,252,235,28,239,163,126,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
