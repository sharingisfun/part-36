The age of Napoleon and Jane Austen, of Beau Brummel and Lord Byron. Ladies wear filmy dresses and dampen their petticoats, while gentlemen duel with pistols at dawn and agonize over the cut of a coat. Fortunes are won and lost at the turn of a card, a decades-old war has turned Europe into a ravaged battlefield, and in London, a child of six can still be hanged for stealing a handkerchief.\n\nThis is the world of Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin. Heir to an earldom, disillusioned Army officer, latter day knight errant.\n\nA master of disguises. Sebastian moves easily from the ballrooms of Mayfair to the rookeries of St. Giles, from the exclusive men's clubs of St. James's to the dangerous docks of the Thames.\n\nThink Mr. Darcy with a James Bond edge...\n\n\n                       Book 01 - What Angels Fear\n\n                       Book 02 - When Gods Die\n\n                       Book 03 - Why Mermaids Sing\n\n                       Book 04 - Where Serpents Sleep\n\n                       Book 05 - What Remains of Heaven\n\n                       Book 06 - Where Shadows Dance\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9add0a23b38888b7d0aee156e0b57c5b6b87d8","amp;dn":"Sebastian+St.+Cyr+Series+by+C.+S.+Harris+%28Books+1+to+6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9add0a23b38888b7d0aee156e0b57c5b6b87d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,154,221,10,35,179,136,136,183,208,174,225,86,224,181,124,91,107,135,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
