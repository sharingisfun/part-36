Cherry picked by former manager Allen Klein as a result of a bitter lawsuit that found a similar anthology contrived by Bill Wyman going unreleased, this treasure trove of cuts is a boon to both die-hard and casual Stones fans. It kicks off with a lush, orchestrated version of &quot;Out Of Time,&quot; one of a handful of outtakes (along with &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot;) featuring a studio full of session musicians including John McLaughlin, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones.\n\nOverseen by Mick Jagger and then manager Andrew Oldham, these tracks provide interesting insight to a time when the Stones' success allowed them to dish off songs to other UK artists, using versions like these as demos. Other highlights include a killer cover of Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot; (originally recorded for LET IT BLEED) and &quot;Memo From Turner,&quot; a Jagger/Richards number cut with Al Kooper and penned for the soundtrack to the Jagger vehicle Performance. Making its CD debut in 2002, METAMORPHOSIS remains a jewel that still glimmers almost three decades after its release.\n\n\n\n   1. Out of Time - 3:22\n   2.
