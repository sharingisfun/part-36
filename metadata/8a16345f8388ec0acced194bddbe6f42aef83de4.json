So imagine that you only have one year left to live. What would you do differently? \r\n\r\nFor one year Stephen Levine (also the author of Who Dies?) consciously chose activities, relationships, and spiritual practices that reflected life's urgency rather than life's complacency. From his experience comes this year-long program of strategies and guided meditations to help us feel satiated when our numbers come up. Lessons include &quot;Gratitude,&quot; &quot;Disposing of the Corpse,&quot; &quot;Finding the Lotus Before Winter,&quot; and &quot;Beyond the House of Death.&quot; â€“This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a16345f8388ec0acced194bddbe6f42aef83de4","amp;dn":"A+Year+to+Live%3A+How+to+Live+This+Year+as+If+It+Were+Your+Last","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a16345f8388ec0acced194bddbe6f42aef83de4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,22,52,95,131,136,236,10,204,237,25,75,221,190,111,66,174,248,61,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
