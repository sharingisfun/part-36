Siegfried, born of the love between a mortal man and a Valkyrie, is a young orphan being raised by Mime, one of the last of the dwarf-goblin Nibelungs, in a dark forest with only wolves for friends and family. While his foster parent only wants to live in peace and solitude, Siegfried yearns to discover who his real parents were and live amongst his own kind, not knowing that Odin, father of the Norse gods, has a destiny planned for him: to fight the dragon Fafnir, guardian of the Rheingold!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebaf9ee3f61d049008d2e0464012164eb5dfd809","amp;dn":"Siegfried+v1+01+%282012%29+%28Digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebaf9ee3f61d049008d2e0464012164eb5dfd809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,175,158,227,246,29,4,144,8,210,224,70,64,18,22,78,181,223,216,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
