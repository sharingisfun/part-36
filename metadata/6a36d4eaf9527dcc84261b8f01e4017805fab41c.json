Drawing on a wide range of sources, including recently declassified government documents, court records, and personal interviews with intelligence and law enforcement officials around the world, Matthew Levitt examines HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beginnings, its first violent forays in Lebanon, and then its terrorist activities and criminal enterprises abroad in Europe, the Middle East, South America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and finally in North America. \n\nLevitt also describes HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unit dedicated to supporting Palestinian militant groups and HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement in training and supporting insurgents who fought US troops in post-Saddam Iraq. The book concludes with a look at HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s integral, ongoing role in IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadow war with Israel and the West, including plots targeting civilians around the world.\n\nLevitt shows convincingly that HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willingness to use violence at home and abroad, its global reach, and its proxy-patron relationship with the Iranian regime should be of serious concern. Hezbollah is an important book for scholars, policymakers, students, and the general public interested in international security, terrorism, international criminal organizations, and Middle East studies.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a36d4eaf9527dcc84261b8f01e4017805fab41c","amp;dn":"Hezbollah+by+Matthew+Levitt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a36d4eaf9527dcc84261b8f01e4017805fab41c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,54,212,234,249,82,125,204,132,38,27,143,1,228,1,120,5,250,180,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
