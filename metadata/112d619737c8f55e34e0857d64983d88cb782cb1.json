This album is filled with many catchy songs, leaving it as a terrific follow-up to Back In Black.\n\n1.For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)- This famous song starts off the album with a hard, rocking beat. 9/10\n2.Put The Finger On You- A solid rocker with a catchy chorus. 8/10\n3.Let&amp;#039;s Get It Up- An awesome upbeat song with great guitar and another catchy chorus. One of my favorites. 10/10\n4.Inject The Venom- Solid, hard rock song. &amp;#039;Nuff said. 8/10\n5.Snowballed- Okay song. Good beat as always, but not a standout track. 7/10\n6.Evil Walks- A great song with an ominous chorus and good lyrics. 9/10\n7.C.O.D.- Kind of filler, not really a standout track. 6/10\n8.Breaking The Rules- The beginning guitar and the beat during the verses is good, but the chorus is a little repetitive. 8/10\n9.Night Of The Long Knives- Very good song with extremely catchy guitar in the beginning. 9/10\n10.Spellbound- Mediocre, not a great way to end a rock-filled album, but has well-written lyrics. 7/10\n\nOverall, this album is one of AC/DC&amp;#039;s finest masterpieces, filled with innovative rock songs and catchy guitar licks. If you loved Back In Black (which most people do), then you&amp;#039;ll love For Those About To Rock We Salute You.\n\nTracks Include.\n\n1  \tFor Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\n2 \tI Put the Finger on You\n3 \tLet&amp;#039;s Get It Up\n4 \tInject the Venom\n5 \tSnowballed\n6 \tEvil Walks\n7 \tC.O.D.\n8 \tBreaking the Rules\n9 \tNight of the Long Knives\n10 \tSpellbound.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\nLame mp3@320kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:112d619737c8f55e34e0857d64983d88cb782cb1","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.+For+Those+About+To+Rock.+Re-mastered%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"112d619737c8f55e34e0857d64983d88cb782cb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,45,97,151,55,200,245,94,52,224,133,125,100,152,61,136,203,120,44,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
