Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Is DeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on pieces of paper as instructed, Josh find himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: if Josh will not admit that Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Is Dead,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he must prove GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence, he will fail the course and hinder his lofty academic goals. With almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it just be easier just to write Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Is DeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and put the whole incident behind him? GODÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NOT DEAD weaves together multiple stories of faith, doubt and disbelief, culminating in a dramatic call to action. The film will educate, entertain, and inspire moviegoers to explore what they really believe about God, igniting important conversations and life-changing decisions.\n\nGODÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NOT DEAD features a talented cast of actors including Kevin Sorbo (SOUL SURFER, HERCULES, ANDROMEDA), Shane Harper (GOOD LUCK CHARLIE, HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2), David A.R. White (BROTHER WHITE, REVELATION ROAD and JERUSALEM COUNTDOWN), and Dean Cain (LOIS &amp; CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN), with special appearances by Christian super-band Newsboys and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duck DynastyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Willie and Korie Robertson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f46d5864926aecf14a776fbde6dbe4e1b79096","amp;dn":"God%27s+Not+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f46d5864926aecf14a776fbde6dbe4e1b79096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,244,109,88,100,146,106,236,241,74,119,111,189,230,219,228,225,183,144,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
