So how is it that I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard all that much about her? I was questioning my standing as a music-nerd when I read that Donna the Buffalo tours primarily in the Midwest and on the East Coast. That made me feel slightly better, but not much. Even way out here on the West Coast, Nevins is an artist who is definitely worth knowing about.\n\nWood and Stone, which is NevinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second solo release, is a foot-stomping, down-home collection of songs that is polished enough to handle repeat listens, but sparse enough to bare the grit and emotional weight that I love about roots music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb14a4d5a84ab0d58c559a7e1d6ff8725ed1e6e5","amp;dn":"Tara+Nevins+-+Wood+and+Stone+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb14a4d5a84ab0d58c559a7e1d6ff8725ed1e6e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,20,164,213,168,74,176,213,140,85,154,126,29,111,248,114,94,209,230,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
