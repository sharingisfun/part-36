This game features characters from the classic Marvel Comics lineup. Four characters Psylocke, Wolverine, Juggernaut, and Magneto return from Capcom's previous comic-based fighter, X-MEN: Children of the Atom. New characters include Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk, and more. You'll find the type of gameplay that gamers have come to expect from the STREET FIGHTER series, including dragon punches, fireballs, and huge combos. MARVEL SUPER HEROES is based on the hugely popular arcade game of the same name, and Capcom has even thrown in a few new characters to spice things up. If you're feeling sociable, you can also take on a friend in Versus mode and see who is the baddest super hero.\n\nRelease Date: September 29, 1997\nMSRP: 29.99 USD\nT for Teen: Animated Violence\nGenre: Fighting\nPublisher: Capcom\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\n\nSupported Functions\nNumber Of Players: 1-2\nMemory Card\nMemory Blocks: 1 block\n\nCharacters from the Marvel Comics lineup; large number of characters; one-on-one fights; fireballs and combos; based on the arcade game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5235411b508359f94877d67ff007c2fcf50cee59","amp;dn":"Marvel+Super+Heroes+PSX+NTSC%2FU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5235411b508359f94877d67ff007c2fcf50cee59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,53,65,27,80,131,89,249,72,119,214,127,240,7,194,252,245,12,238,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
