In his Ã¢â‚¬Å“tweenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ years, Tait filmed music videos in his bedroom, inviting whatever friends might come over to star in his mini-productions. Whether parodying MTV staples or creating their own new form of kiddie punk music, Tait dreamed of one day becoming just like the new wave idols in the posters pinned to his walls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b5ab6014d15169feee3a1cac67782d2375d4950","amp;dn":"Devin+Tait+-+It%27s+Never+The+Way+You+Imagine+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b5ab6014d15169feee3a1cac67782d2375d4950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,90,182,1,77,21,22,159,238,227,161,202,198,119,130,210,55,93,73,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
