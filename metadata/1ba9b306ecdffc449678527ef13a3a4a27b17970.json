Formed in 2001 in Orange         |\n|  County, CA, the group began with singer Joe Brown, bassist Phil Pirrone,  |\n|  drummer Brett Dinovo, and guitarists Dan Arnold and Nathan Lindeman.      |\n|  Their first show was a mere two weeks after forming, and it started a     |\n|  buzz about the guys that they continued to build upon throughout the      |\n|  local circuit. They soon recorded and self-released the Withered EP, and  |\n|  in the summer of 2002 were signed to Ferret Records.                      |\n|                                                                            |\n|  After recording with Steve Evetts (Snapcase, Hatebreed) in the            |\n|  producer&amp;#039;s chair, A Static Lullaby released ...And Don&amp;#039;t Forget to        |\n|  Breathe in March 2003. The album laid the foundation for the band&amp;#039;s       |\n|  music, yet hinted at a creativity not yet completely tapped. Over a year  |\n|  of straight touring followed, which led to strained relations within the  |\n|  band, eventually causing Dinovo to quit and return to school. A Static    |\n|  Lullaby soon signed to Columbia and began work on their follow-up album.  |\n|  Faso Latido appeared in April 2005 with Lou Giordano (Sunny Day Real      |\n|  Estate, Taking Back Sunday) producing and friend Sammy Siegler (Youth of  |\n|  Today, Gorilla Biscuits) filling in on drums.                             |\n|                                                                            |\n|  With the album complete and the search about to begin for a permanent     |\n|  drummer, Dinovo approached his old bandmates at a show and wound up       |\n|  rejoining the group in mid-2005. That same year also found A Static       |\n|  Lullaby with a spot on the popular Taste of Chaos tour alongside the      |\n|  Used and Killswitch Engage. January 2006 left the band in an uncertain    |\n|  state after the departure of Pirrone, Dinovo, and Lindeman over musical   |\n|  differences and the band&amp;#039;s own exit from Columbia. But they were soon     |\n|  embraced by California indie Fearless Records, and by March, Brown and    |\n|  Arnold were again part of a full band with the addition of guitarist      |\n|  John Death, bassist Dane Poppin, and drummer Jarrod Alexander to A        |\n|  Static Lullaby&amp;#039;s lineup. Working again with producer Evetts, the          |\n|  refreshed quintet issued their self-titled album on Fearless that         |\n|  October and headed out on tour alongside I Am Ghost.                      |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba9b306ecdffc449678527ef13a3a4a27b17970","amp;dn":"A+Static+Lullaby-Self+Titled+%5BAdvance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba9b306ecdffc449678527ef13a3a4a27b17970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,169,179,6,236,223,252,68,150,120,82,126,241,58,58,74,39,177,121,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
