In this chapter, you get tips on how to select your brand and ISO of film, and how that choice affects the final product. I also discuss how to take a properly exposed photo.\r\nOpening your film can be a little tricky. I break this down, with different technique suggestions, and also tell you how to load your film reel and tank.\r\nThe next chapter is all about processing film for 35mm and 120mm. I talk about how to set up chemicals, use them, and dispose of them properly.\r\nI also discuss how to make contact sheets and how to use them to your benefit for making prints.\r\nI walk you through basic printmaking, from filter selection to test strips to the final print\r\nDodging and burning is a more advanced technique to further enhance the overall look of your image\r\nFinal print prep is also a very important step in the entire printmaking process. If you donâ€™t properly drain, dry, and press your photos, they wonâ€™t be of great quality for display or selling.\r\nToning is another advanced technique which will give your prints beautiful color and a unique pop others wonâ€™t have.\r\nItâ€™s always important to digitize your prints and negatives so that you have them for further reference and for your website later as well.\r\nAnd so much more!\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct Details:\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 405 pages\r\nSimultaneous Device Usage: Unlimited\r\nPublisher: Sender Publishing (March 22 2016)\r\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services LLC\r\nLanguage: English\r\nASIN: B01DCPPPQS\r\n\r\n\r\nBTC - 1CZ4nTozpgfgqufWhiXDtBu9pVurd41SPz\r\n\r\nenjoy...\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n.:.Shailab.:.\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/shailab/\r\n \nhttps://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3367b05f72747ab6ac0463a1984771f51b8061f","amp;dn":"Complete+Guide+Mastering+Basic+Darkroom+Photography+James+Carren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3367b05f72747ab6ac0463a1984771f51b8061f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,54,123,5,247,39,71,171,106,192,70,58,25,132,119,31,81,184,6,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
