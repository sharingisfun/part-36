The good news is the film looks manifestly better and sharper than it did on DVD, especially once we get inside the monastery.&quot;\n\nSound, DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track wasn't a bombastic, mind blowing track,\nno extreme sound effects at all there so DTS @768 is just as fine, saving almost 3GB.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b3ea81acf059be319351287237e88eff797941","amp;dn":"The+Name+of+the+Rose+1986+BDRemux+multi-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b3ea81acf059be319351287237e88eff797941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,179,234,129,172,240,89,190,49,147,81,40,114,55,232,142,255,121,121,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
