Director Steve Metze examines several different groups including historical miniature gamers, role-players, and those known simply as &quot;LARPers.&quot; The film also explores opposition from religious groups, negative media portrayals, and some of the meanest 'man-on-the-street' interviews ever committed to video. Meet the Gamers, learn their exotic language, see their bizarre rituals, gasp at their semi-authentic costumes, and thrill to the painting techniques on their miniatures!\n\nUber Goober\n\nSource: DVD\n\nuber goober.avi\n\nGeneral:\n\nFormat: AVI\nFile Size: 699.51 MiB\nDuration: 1h 27mn\nBitrate: 1 117 Kbps\nSubtitles: None\nEncoder: FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com \nEncoded Date:\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec: XviD \nBitrate: 977 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 29.970 fps\nScan Type: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.173\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 1.391\nResolution: 512x368\nEncoder Settings: \n\nAudio #1:\n\nFormat: MPEG Audio\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nChannels: 2 channels\nSampling Rate: 48.0 KHz\nResolution: %Audio_Resolution%","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee55a9e6b265859ec576055221d4edd7716e4cf6","amp;dn":"Uber+Goober+-+Steve+Metze+%5B2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee55a9e6b265859ec576055221d4edd7716e4cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,85,169,230,178,101,133,158,197,118,5,82,33,212,237,215,113,110,76,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
