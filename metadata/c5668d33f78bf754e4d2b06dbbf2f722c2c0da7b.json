In the two years that I've been there, I have never fought in anything that I didn't make myself. I began studying armor construction at about the same time I started, but didn't really get started on making anything decent until about a year ago, and this book was extremely helpful in getting me get turned in the right direction. The second half of the book provides a very useful manual for making specific pieces; for example, I absolutely love the thoroughness of his description for making a leg harness. The first half of the book, however, was the most useful; descriptions of the tools, applications, hammerwork techniques, polishing, strapping, padding, and the like were all covered in very thoughtful detail, which makes this book an excellent source of reference that I use quite often. I don't have any particular gripes about this book, but I will say this: this book is intended for historically authentic designs, so a bit of alteration might be required contrary to the design schemes presented if you're in the SCA. However, overall, I don't feel that that is enough to bring this book down to four stars, especially since I believe that historical authenticity, rather than SCA armor, was his goal when he wrote this book; overall, it ranks at a very solid five (although I would really like to see the author do another on SCA armor design).&quot;\n\n\nHave fun with it, and seed if you like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5668d33f78bf754e4d2b06dbbf2f722c2c0da7b","amp;dn":"Brian+Price+-+Techniques+Of+Medieval+Armour+Reproduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5668d33f78bf754e4d2b06dbbf2f722c2c0da7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,102,141,51,247,139,247,84,228,210,176,109,187,242,247,34,194,192,218,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
