The band recorded two albums in 1988 and 1990, though Orbison died before the second was recorded.\nIn early April 1988, George Harrison was in Los Angeles, California and needed to record a B-side for a European 12-inch single. Jeff Lynne was also in Los Angeles producing some tracks for Roy Orbison as well as Tom PettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first solo album. While having dinner with Lynne and Orbison, Harrison related how he needed to record a new track and wanted to do it the next day. Both offered to help. Needing a studio on short notice, Harrison suggested they call Bob Dylan, who had a home studio. After dinner, George stopped by Tom PettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house to pick up his guitar for the next dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s session and invited him along too. Gathering at DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Malibu home the following day, they wrote and recorded the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Handle with CareÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in five hours, with all five sharing the vocals. The track was considered too good to be used as a B-side, so Harrison hatched the idea to form a band and record another nine songs for an album. The group got together again for nine days in May, recording the basic tracks and vocals at David A. StewartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home studio in Los Angeles. Overdubs and mixing were done in England at HarrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home studio F.P.S.H.O.T. (Friar Park Studio, Henley-on-Thames). Masquerading as the Wilbury brothers, the participants would be known as Nelson (Harrison), Otis (Lynne), Lucky (Dylan), Lefty (Orbison) and Charlie T. Jr. (Petty).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab4c61b052bdc31640c19d6a2e4cfdb0e4030db","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+383","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab4c61b052bdc31640c19d6a2e4cfdb0e4030db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,180,198,27,5,43,220,49,100,12,25,214,162,228,207,219,14,64,48,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
