It spans (merely!) his early days in Canada, circa 1963, with his Shadows-aping garage band the Squires, through to 1972ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epochal Harvest. The CD version gathers 114 tracks on eight discs, of which 40-odd are previously released.. \nYoung compiled and remastered the whole lot himself. Air any disc from Archives Vol. 1 and you will hear his very best songs from that given era. Starting with YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s compositions for the late-Sixties combo Buffalo Springfield, we follow the crystallisation of the music, which soundtracked US hippiedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s withdrawal from AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cities into its vast open spaces: his spinetingling falsetto tenor; his loose, speculative guitar playing (witness labyrinthine takes on Words, Down By the River, etc); his effortless song craft, the words both vernacular and poetic, sometimes politically angry (Ohio, cut with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash), sometimes tear jerkingly romantic (Only Love Can Break Your Heart, live, with peerless harmonies again from C, S&amp;N). Of three live discs, two are solo, with hilariously rambling between-song monologues; the third is a rip-roaring set with Crazy Horse in tow. \nConsistently electrifying, overloaded with fabulous melodies and lazily brilliant playing, this is the full story of one of rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true greats ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or at least, the complete early chapters. Vol. 2, covering the rest of the Seventies, could be even better. \n\nDisc 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Early Years (1966-1968 )\n\n\n\n1.
