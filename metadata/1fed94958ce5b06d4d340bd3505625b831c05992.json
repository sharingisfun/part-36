It was given out at some Japanese tradeshow after the game was released.  Quality isn't too good, but you can't really complain too much, its free.  Made by Akira Toriyama, character designer from the game and creator of Dragon Ball/Z\n\n\nEnjoy and seed please, I have a bad connection and its hard to upload shit like this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fed94958ce5b06d4d340bd3505625b831c05992","amp;dn":"Chrono+Trigger+Anime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fed94958ce5b06d4d340bd3505625b831c05992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,237,148,149,140,229,176,109,77,52,11,211,80,86,37,184,49,192,89,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
