Its title track was a hit single and the album included the first use of the term 'dirty south' (originated by Cool Breeze), on the track of the same name. The Goodie Mob quartet includes Cee-Lo Green, Big Gipp, Khujo, and T-Mo. Guest vocalists on this album include Andre 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, Cool Breeze, and Witchdoctor. Soul Food received critical acclaim for its raw, Southern, socially conscious lyrics and original production from Organized Noize. In 1996, it was certified gold as sales stand at over 500,000 units in the U.S.[2] The album is dedicated to the memory of Sheila J. Tyler-Calloway, Cee-Lo's deceased mother. Soul Food, along with Outkast's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, has been regarded as one of the two albums that brought southern hip hop to the mainstream, and it is regarded as a southern classic.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tWriter(s)\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Free&quot;  \tThomas Burton, Organized Noize\t1:23\n2.\t&quot;Thought Process&quot; (featuring AndrÃƒÂ© 3000 of OutKast)\tRobert Barnett, AndrÃƒÂ© Benjamin, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knightion, Organized Noize\t5:09\n3.\t&quot;Red Dog&quot; (Skit)\t \t0:23\n4.\t&quot;Dirty South&quot; (featuring Big Boi of OutKast &amp; Cool Breeze)\tKing George, Antwan Patton, Organized Noize\t3:34\n5.\t&quot;Cell Therapy&quot;  \tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t4:37\n6.\t&quot;Sesame Street&quot;  \tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t4:36\n7.\t&quot;Guess Who&quot;  \tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t4:49\n8.\t&quot;Serenity Prayer&quot; (Skit)\t \t0:09\n9.\t&quot;Fighting&quot; (featuring Joi)\tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Michael Johnson, Willie Knighton\t5:45\n10.\t&quot;Blood&quot; (Skit)\t \t0:53\n11.\t&quot;Live at the O.M.N.I.&quot;  \tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t4:58\n12.\t&quot;Goodie Bag&quot;  \tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t4:25\n13.\t&quot;Soul Food&quot; (featuring Sleepy Brown)\tRobert Barnett, Brandon Bennett, Marc Benno, Bill Boatman, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Pigmeat Markham, Leon Russell, Organized Noize\t3:56\n14.\t&quot;Funeral&quot; (Skit)\t \t0:54\n15.\t&quot;I Didn't Ask to Come&quot;  \tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t4:08\n16.\t&quot;Rico&quot; (Skit)\t \t0:07\n17.\t&quot;The Coming&quot; (featuring Witchdoctor)\tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Eric Johnson, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t5:47\n18.\t&quot;Cee-Lo&quot; (Skit)\t \t0:28\n19.\t&quot;The Day After&quot; (featuring Roni)\tRobert Barnett, Thomas Burton, Cameron Gipp, Willie Knighton, Organized Noize\t5:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:225bf54bfb6cae88990b4e620742cea544738056","amp;dn":"Goodie+Mob+-+Soul+Food+%281995%29+-+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"225bf54bfb6cae88990b4e620742cea544738056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,91,245,75,251,108,174,136,153,11,78,98,7,66,206,165,68,115,128,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
