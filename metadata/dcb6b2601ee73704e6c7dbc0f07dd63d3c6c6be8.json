The second track is &quot;Mestieri che si inventano&quot; a true ballad, praising precisely, the so-called trades that are invented, such as the songwriter. &quot;Allora chi&quot; is another piece-suit against the company at that time (which looks pretty darn today's society), very rock and Bennato with a more biting tone than ever. &quot;Era una festa&quot; is probably the most useless piece of the album. Legend has it, that it was dedicated to his friend Francesco De Gregori and in fact, in the text, a &quot;Francesco&quot; appears.\n\nContinuing in listening, comes &quot;La citta' Obliqua&quot;, a very sweet ballad, which, as you can easily guess from the title, is a kind of homage-complaint, the city of Naples. And behold, &quot;Tu vuoi l' America.&quot; Quet'ultima is one of the most beloved songs and discussed by Bennato, the &quot;usual&quot; someone says that it represents the passage of the singer-songwriter genre commercial (which then will result in the success of &quot;Viva La Mamma&quot;), instead of someone else loves it madness. I think it's just a beautiful love song and I think that sometimes there is no need to make treaties of philosophy, to talk about love. To close the album include: &quot;Chi Beve-Chi Beve&quot;, another song the funny and sincere about the city of Naples and &quot;La Televisione Che FilicitÃƒÂ ,&quot; in which Bennato, inveighs against the TV (and to think that reality shows do not exist yet ).
