These recordings are on the Vigotone Holly set, but they don't sound as good as they do here. Norman Petty had several of these tracks overdubbed and released on two different albums. Here, they are undubbed.\n\nffp file and artwork are included.\n\nSpecial thanks to bigdavej\n\nPlease preserve the lossless quality of this material.\n\nUploaded to Demonoid December 1, 2011.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRemasters Workshop\nRMW 794","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b6045486afd6724159e83cd70a6b79323ff9f99","amp;dn":"Buddy+Holly+-+Something+Special+From+Buddy+Holly+%28vinyl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b6045486afd6724159e83cd70a6b79323ff9f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,96,69,72,106,253,103,36,21,158,131,205,112,166,183,147,35,255,159,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
