The story centers on a hero more concerned with his libido than serving justice. After an unexpected sell out, Willard can't recall anything about his story. That night the book's hero shows up outside Willard's window refusing to return to the comic until he finds true love. Exasperated, Willard is forced to help the lovesick hero meet the perfect woman. But he'll need to hurry because the book's villain, a homicidal maniac, has entered his world as well.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90229d170e0f61fc874a6c8401cc044b03dab222","amp;dn":"Reality+Check+02+%28Darkness-Empire%29%28Image+Comics%29%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90229d170e0f61fc874a6c8401cc044b03dab222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,34,157,23,14,15,97,252,135,74,108,132,1,204,4,75,3,218,178,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
