It's no naughtier than the scene from Stanley Kubrick's movie\n\nTHE SHINING where Jack Nicholson uses an axe to break through a door.\n\nOn this LP a Hammer is used....very clever.  BANNED?   Why?\n\n\nJan Hammer is an accomplished drummer and producer.  He plays synth with the \n\narticulative nuance of a guitarist.  Perhaps his use of the POWELL PROBE\n\ncontroller helped him accomplish this. (ROGER POWELL; TODD RUNDGREN'S UTOPIA)\n\n\n\nThese rips are from CDRW media utilizing a standalone burner and somewhat \n\nexpensive &quot;audiophile&quot; gear.\n\n\nGiven that, a few pops and clicks are simply a part of the package.  \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e1aed8bf2e48ef0cb625d69118fed05a40216d","amp;dn":"Jan+Hammer+%2F+Jerry+Goodman+++VINYL+rips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e1aed8bf2e48ef0cb625d69118fed05a40216d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,225,174,216,191,46,72,239,12,182,37,214,145,24,254,208,90,64,33,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
