Formed in 1976, the group consists of Bono (vocals and guitar) \nThe Edge (guitar, keyboards and vocals) Adam Clayton (bass guitar) and Larry Mullen, Jr. \n(drums and percussion) U2s early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate \ninfluences from many genres of popular music. Throughout the groups musical pursuits, they have \nmaintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's textural guitar \nplaying and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, \nfocus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\n\n\n   1. U2 - Sunday Bloody Sunday                               [04:39]\n   2.
