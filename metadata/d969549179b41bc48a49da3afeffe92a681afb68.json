It replaces the &quot;Lite&quot; version installed on the Nuvi.\n\nThe multilingual word and phrase bank supports nine languages and dialects, including American English, British English, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, European Spanish, and Latin American Spanish.\n\nUsing the Language Guide, you can look up and translate more than 17,000 words or 20,000 phrases per language. And with Nuvi text-to-speech interface, you can get a spoken pronunciation of each word or phrase in the data bank, along with gender and part-of-speech information.\n\nN.B. I&amp;#039;ve carefully read the whole Garmin Travel Guide: Europe post (by the way: I tried to install that Travel Guide on my Nuvi 760 with NO success... :? ) and I think this is more or less the same case. I don&amp;#039;t have the possibility to prove, as I got the original (buyed) product, installed first on my &quot;old&quot; Nuvi 360 and now on my new Nuvi 760; so, good luck to all\n\nIgnore the modified Jetmouse 1.3 keygen that is floating around. It doesn&amp;#039;t have the Language Guide ID menu.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d969549179b41bc48a49da3afeffe92a681afb68","amp;dn":"Garmin+Language+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d969549179b41bc48a49da3afeffe92a681afb68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,105,84,145,121,180,27,196,138,73,218,58,254,255,233,42,104,26,251,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
