The files have been custom updated as of April 20th, 2014 , and more information on the server can be found at http://Lootfest.Guildlaunch.com ... there is a vanilla compile of macroquest2 (macroquest2.com) from the good folks at MQEmulator.net \n\nThis client is not intended for use with any other server, but with the right knowledge, can probably be used with several other custom source code servers on eqemulator.net , provided all custom files are replaced with the target servers files. If Lootfest's custom files have changed at the time you are downloading this torrent, simply go to lootfest website and replace all those recently updated custom files. Thank you and have a nice day!
