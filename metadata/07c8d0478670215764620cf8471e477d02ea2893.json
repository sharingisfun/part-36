Dick asks: What if God--or a being \ncalled Yah--were alive and in exile on a distant planet? How could a \nsecond coming succeed against the high technology and finely tuned rationalized \nevil of the modern police state? The Divine Invasion &quot;blends Judaism, \nKabalah, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity into a fascinating fable of \nhuman existence&quot; (West Coast Revew of Books).\nFrom the Back Cover\nGod is not dead, he has merely been exiled to an extraterrestrial planet. \nAnd it is on this planet that God meets Herb Asher and convinces him \nto help retake Earth from the demonic Belial. Featuring virtual reality, \nparallel worlds, and interstellar travel, The Divine Invasion blends \nphilosophy and adventure in a way few authors can achieve.\n\nAs the middle novel of DickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s VALIS trilogy, The Divine Invasion plays \na pivotal role in answering the questions raised by the first novel, \nexpanding that world while exploring just how much anyone can really \nknowÃ¢â‚¬â€even God himself.\n\n\nPoster's Note: I'll try to find and post the other Valis books, unless \nsomeone beats me to it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07c8d0478670215764620cf8471e477d02ea2893","amp;dn":"Philip+K+Dick+-+The+Divine+Invasion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07c8d0478670215764620cf8471e477d02ea2893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,200,208,71,134,112,33,87,100,98,12,248,71,30,71,125,2,234,40,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
