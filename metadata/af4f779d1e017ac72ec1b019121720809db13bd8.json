One may think $60 is too expensive for this kind of software but we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think so. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dig deeper: There are two main types of virtual cover applications: Hardware accelerated and Software renderers.\n\nHardware accelerated renderers\n\nHardware accelerated renderers require modern 3D acceleration hardware that may cost hundreds of dollars. But even if you already have this hardware, your result may be poor as there are no hardware renderers that can calculate sky dome lighting.\n\nSoftware renderers\n\nSoftware renderers donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t require 3D acceleration hardware and thus perform all calculations on the CPU. There are two types of software renderers: polygonal and raytracing. Polygonal renderers calculate light in the corner of objects and interpolate it over the object. Raytracing renderers perform physical simulation of light distribution and produce photorealistic images.\n\nNow for the facts:\n\n1. There are no hardware accelerated cover renderers that can calculate smooth shadow.\n2. There are no polygonal software renderers that can calculate sky dome lighting.\n3. Most polygonal software renderers use fake shadows.\n4. Most virtual cover renderers use simplistic lighting.\n5. Most virtual cover renderers canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t calculate correct shadows on the faces of complex objects (such as open books)\n\nBox Shot 3D is the only virtual cover software that can do these things:\n\n1. Calculate true physically simulated shadows.\n2. Calculate sky dome lighting.\n3. Allow fine tuning of the lighting environment. (Direct, ambient, specular, sky dome).\n\nOS version: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or later\n\nLink for more information: http://www.boxshot3d.com/\n\n\nCourtesy of Nowsendit\n\nNewer versions will not accept the serial and disable the renders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4f779d1e017ac72ec1b019121720809db13bd8","amp;dn":"Box+Shot+3D+v2.13.1+%2B+SN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af4f779d1e017ac72ec1b019121720809db13bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,79,119,157,30,1,122,199,46,193,176,25,18,23,32,128,157,177,59,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
