In the meantime, a peaceful race of human-like creatures, the boozooks, populated the Earth. After the humans ascended to the surface again, they started a bloody war against this race. The boozooks were mercilessly destroyed, their culture demolished, and in the end of the war the boozooks became the slaves of the humans.\n\nYou play the role of Woodruff, a boy whose foster father, professor Azimuth, was kidnapped by government officials. Apparently, the professor was developing a strange device called &quot;schnibble&quot;, which had something to do with the liberation of the boozooks. Woodruff must find his father, dethrone the evil Bigwig and his corrupt government, and save the boozookian people.\n\nThis is an adventure game with a lot of tricky puzzles, similar in style and design to the famous Gobliiins games by the same creators. Unlike Gobliins, this is a full-fledged adventure where you can move around freely and interact with many characters.\n\nNOTE! ScummVM support this game since version 0.12.0. Latest stable release of ScummVM is 0.11.1, which means that you must download and install the latest subversion build.
