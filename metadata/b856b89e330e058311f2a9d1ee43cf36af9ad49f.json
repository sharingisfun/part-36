Its chapters are by leading researchers and practitioners, making it both a comprehensive and indispensable resource for study and research.\r\n\r\nThe field of viral nanotechnology is new and quickly expanding due to increasing demand of the applications already developed. The editors identify viral nanotechnology as a significant science that concerns itself with how to use the molecular modules that the distinctly different science of molecular engineering only constructs. The current potential applications of viral technology are manifold, with opportunities to revolutionize practices in photonics, catalysis, electronics, energy, biomedicine, health care, and public health.\r\n\r\nThis book emphasizes using viral nanotechnology to improve health. A special emphasis is placed upon using viral nanotechnology for developing vaccines. In addition, it documents viral nanotechnologyâ€™s use as a powerful tool for developing drugs and genetic therapies. There is also great potential in its use as a means for diagnostics, including the development of diagnostic reagents and novel imaging technologies for detecting disease and infectious agents.\r\n\r\nViral nanotechnologyâ€™s rapid and exciting growth is due to the need for new tools in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. The contributors to this volume approach each chapter with the hope that their research and practices will contribute to an improvement in health and life on an unprecedented scale in human history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b856b89e330e058311f2a9d1ee43cf36af9ad49f","amp;dn":"Viral+Nanotechnology+-+Yury+Khudyakov%2C+Paul+Pumpens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b856b89e330e058311f2a9d1ee43cf36af9ad49f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,86,184,158,51,14,5,131,17,242,169,209,238,67,207,54,175,154,212,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
