Features infamous and hard-to-find collaborations with Eisner Award winner GRANT MORRISON: Dan Dare, a post-modern classic that sets the aging and retired iconic British character Dare against a modern British landscape he no longer understands; and Really and Truly, a high-octane psychedelic road-trip torn from the pages of cult comic 2000AD. Hughes' clean graphic style comes to the fore in duotone for The Science Service, written by JOHN FREEMAN, while Hughes explores an evocative noir palette replete with dramatic angular lighting for RAYMOND CHANDLER's Goldfish, adapted by It's Superman author TOM DeHAVEN. In addition to sketchbook pages, merchandise and rare strips-many never seen before or out of print for over a decade-the book features an introduction by comics guru PAUL GRAVETT, who published Hughes' very first strips in his seminal independent comics magazine Escape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9cfe8562e54cca759862a520a982ea92b95264","amp;dn":"Yesterday%27s+Tomorrows+-+Rian+Hughes+Collected+Comics+%282010%29+%28Dig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9cfe8562e54cca759862a520a982ea92b95264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,156,254,133,98,229,76,202,117,152,98,165,32,169,130,234,146,185,82,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
