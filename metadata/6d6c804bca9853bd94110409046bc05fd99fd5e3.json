The story is here, and the music is here, including\nthe original versions of Tennessee Waltz, Slow Poke and Bonaparte's\nRetreat, as well as lesser-known classics like Tennessee Central #9,\nTen Gallon Boogie, Jukebox Blues, Bull Fiddle Boogie, Birmingham\nBounce, Plantation Boogie, and even the first cover version of Blue\nSuede Shoes. All told, there are 151 songs cut for RCA and Bullet\nbetween 1946 and 1958.
