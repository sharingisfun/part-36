I believed in a lot of you, Some before they were even &quot;ready&quot;. Some of you have moved \non to different sounds a few of you have moved onto major deals and signings or have traveled the world twice over. This is more than I could have ever hoped for from a roster. Thank you! Also to the fans of 20/twelve thank you for supporting the label with your positive responses to the music we released in just a short time. This one is for you!\n\n\nWe were the early adopters of of the sound, The purveyors. We were a legion, A Netlabel army.\n\nMay this catalog be shared forever.\n\n\n* The Twenty/Twelve Imprint was a Neltabel that rose to fame in 2009 being the first ever Dubstep netlabel catering to the creative commons license and was also a nominee for &quot;Best New Label&quot; in 2009 for the Dubstepforum Awards without having a single commercial release. In was placed on indefinite hiatus in 2010. This is it's legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9522da5132a60f2c2d7d65178bb68d914f6681","amp;dn":"The+Twenty%2FTwelve+Anthology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9522da5132a60f2c2d7d65178bb68d914f6681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,149,34,218,81,50,166,15,44,45,125,101,23,139,182,141,145,79,102,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
