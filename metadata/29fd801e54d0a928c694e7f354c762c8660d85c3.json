The location is a gorgeous plaza surrounded by historoic buildings. The audience was in fine form and the reception grew stronger as the nigh wore on.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s an amazing performance and for many fans this is the first opportunity they will have to see Alan&amp;#039;s new touring band. These truly professional musicians give a polished performace, and perhaps have the best harmony of any of the various band line-ups that Alan has toured with. An added treat is that Alan sings lead vocals on three songs and all band members take turns doing lead vocals.\n\nenjoy the project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29fd801e54d0a928c694e7f354c762c8660d85c3","amp;dn":"Alan+Parsons+.-.+Live+in+Madrid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29fd801e54d0a928c694e7f354c762c8660d85c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,253,128,30,84,208,169,40,198,148,231,243,84,199,98,200,102,13,133,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
