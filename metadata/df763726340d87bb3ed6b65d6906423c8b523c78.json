They can be found from the various genre links on this page http://www.atlantis.to/music2/music-therapy-sound-therapy.htm\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\n\nMeditation:\n- Homecoming\n- Crystal Gong Chakra Meditation\n- Didgeridoo Orchestra\n- Didgeridoo and Crystal Gong\n\nInstrumental:\n- Going UP?\n- Singing Trees\n\nEnvironmental:\n- Maui Seashore\n\nSinger/Songwriter:\n- Sentimental\n- Guardian Angel\n\nIt also includes a &quot;song&quot; (don't know what to call it) from this page http://www.atlantis.to/music2/sound-music-therapy.htm\n\nMeditation Sound Therapy:\n- Transformation\n\nThis last one has the same &quot;background noises&quot; as Transformation but instead of music on top it has &quot;affirmations&quot; which are positive goal reminding phrases. This isn't music but its great for meditation. From this page http://www.atlantis.to/music2/sound-therapy-music-therapy.htm\n\nGuided Meditation Sound Therapy:\n- Spiritual Development\n\nI actually bought all of these, they are very good and spiritual, please seed them so as many people can benefit as possible. Also I strongly recommend reading his book with a long title, I mentioned it's name before. There's torrents of it all over the internet but theres also a readable and downloadable online version I uploaded on Scribd: http://www.scribd.com/doc/15830682/The-Children-of-the-Law-of-One-and-the-Lost-Teachings-of-Atlantis-by-Jon-Peniel  Also you can check my Scribd profile for more books by him.\n\nAll of these songs are good for meditation other than the two sets of signer/songwriter songs, theyre more for normal listening. &quot;Transformation&quot; and &quot;Crystal Gong Chakra Meditation&quot; are extremely good for meditation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df763726340d87bb3ed6b65d6906423c8b523c78","amp;dn":"Meditation+and+Uplifting+Music+by+Jon+Peniel+%28atlantis.to%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df763726340d87bb3ed6b65d6906423c8b523c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,118,55,38,52,13,135,187,62,214,182,93,105,6,66,60,139,82,60,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
