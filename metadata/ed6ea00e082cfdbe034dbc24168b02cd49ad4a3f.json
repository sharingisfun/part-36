The band was started two years ago by string bassist and band leader, Beau Sample, and has held down a Sunday residency at Chicago's Honky Tonk BBQ ever since. The Fat Babies consists of Sample, bass; Andy Schumm, cornet; John Otto, clarinet/saxophone; Dave Bock, trombone; Paul Asaro, piano; Jake Sanders, tenor banjo; and Alex Hall, drums. Chicago Hot is a collection of 20s and 30s tunes mostly from Chicago's south side. The band takes on recordings by King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Erskine Tate, Freddie Keppard, Jimmy Noone, and Bix Beiderbecke which are infectiously danceable and endlessly engaging. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tDelmark\nCatalog:\t\tDe 253\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Snake Rag\n02.London Cafe Blues\n03.San\n04.Alexander's Ragtime Band\n05.I Surrender Dear\n06.Dardanella\n07.Black Snake Blues\n08.Here Comes The Hot Tamale Man\n09.Froggie Moore\n10.Willow Tree\n11.Weary Blues\n12.Liza (All The Clouds'll Roll Away)\n13.Please\n14.Susie\n15.Tight Like This\n16.Stomp Off, Let's Go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6ea00e082cfdbe034dbc24168b02cd49ad4a3f","amp;dn":"The+Fat+Babies+-+Chicago+Hot+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BJazz%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6ea00e082cfdbe034dbc24168b02cd49ad4a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,110,160,14,8,44,253,190,3,77,188,36,22,139,2,205,73,173,74,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
