With his songwriting, John Rzeznik confronts some of the issues that have become part of many people's everyday lives:\n'I wanted some of the material on this album to address the disillusionment of the difficult period we live in; I wanted to give a voice to the emotional uncertainty that accompanies hard times.'\n'So many people are struggling to keep it together through tough economic conditions and two wars that seem to have no end in sight. The ones who bear the brunt of these burdens are everyday people. That's who I want to speak to.'\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d42332e69e5804c29384ea65599a608ee88bd2f","amp;dn":"Goo+Goo+Dolls+-+Something+For+The+Rest+Of+Us+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d42332e69e5804c29384ea65599a608ee88bd2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,66,51,46,105,229,128,76,41,56,78,166,85,153,166,8,238,136,189,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
