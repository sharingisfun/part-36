All HDTVRip-songs (except I'ms a God) are 160kbps Mono. Because originally they sounded like voice in left channel and music in right channel. Sorry for that.\n\nI'ms a God is 320 kbps Stereo.\n\nHamburger Time, A Bloody Mess, and Fun on a Weekend in Cayman Islands songs are in 224 kbps (original audiotrack bitrate from Dethhealth episode)\n\nList of the songs:\n\n01 - Crush the Industry by Dethklok (3:02)\n02 - Organic Destruction by Dethklok (2:06)\n03 - Pentuplemint Gum by Dethklok (0:27)\n04 - A Bloody Mess by Dethklok (1:31)\n05 - Fun on a Weekend in Cayman Islands (instrumental) by Dethklok (0:21)\n06 - Hamburger Time by Dethklok (2:29)\n07 - I'ms a God by Skwisgaar Skwigelf (1:56)\n08 - Biological Warfare by Dethklok (1:07)\n09 - I am Toki by Toki Wartooth (1:46)\n10 - Last Resort ;) by Get Thee Hence (0:35)\n11 - Why Can't Everything Be Easy? by William Murderface (1:24)\n12 - Pickles' Rehab Saga by Pickles &amp; Drum Machine (8:30)\n13 - Reborn by Dethklok (1:48)\n14 - Atomic Clown by Zazz Blammymatazz (1:27)\n15 - Dory McLean by Zazz Blammymatazz (1:17)\n16 - Fun on a Weekend in Syria (instrumental) by Dethklok (0:23)\n17 - Searching for Dethklok (instrumental) by Dethklok (1:09)\n18 - The Beginning by Dethklok (3:23)\n\np.s. I waited for DVD to rip songs from it.. but screw this. I'll better wait for original CD.\np.p.s. I know there is rip like that somewhere. This is just my take on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e672722b7c931db44edaae73f6b2f6a55af199e","amp;dn":"Dethklok+-+Season+3+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e672722b7c931db44edaae73f6b2f6a55af199e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,103,39,34,183,201,49,219,68,237,170,231,63,107,47,106,85,175,25,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
