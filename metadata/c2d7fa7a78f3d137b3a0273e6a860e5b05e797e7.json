He now returns home only to find himself facing another kind of war.The front line in the decrepit Estonian town runs between Eastern and Western culture, men and women, common sense and madness. Somewhere amidst these battles is his daughter, who Kirotaja has decided to find after all the years of absence. His only leads are the sound of his daughter crying, heard once on the telephone, and a dog-eared notebook full of letters addressed to her. But the town has other plans for him and the women running it seem to take him for their savior from the nagging feeling of emptiness that has enveloped them.\n\nDirector: Sulev Keedus\nWriters: Madis KÃƒÂµiv, Sulev Keedus\nStars: Roman Baskin, Ketter Habakukk, Alina Karmazina\nCountry: Estonia | Finland | Mauritania | Latvia\nLanguage: Estonian\nRelease Date: January 2011 (Estonia)\n\n691 MiB\n1h 53mn\n853 Kbps\n720 pixels\n400 pixels\n16:9\n25.000 fps\nAC-3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d7fa7a78f3d137b3a0273e6a860e5b05e797e7","amp;dn":"Kirjad.Inglile.%5BLetters+to+Angel%5D.%282011%29.DVDRip-DoKtor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d7fa7a78f3d137b3a0273e6a860e5b05e797e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,215,250,122,120,243,209,55,179,160,39,62,106,134,14,91,5,231,151,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
