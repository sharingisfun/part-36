Just one minor bug that is imposible to fix for version 1.5.2 for now (names of the items of basic components shows as &quot;umnamed&quot;) but the recipes and all the content works perfect. This will be fixed when the modder of Universal Electricity or &quot;UE&quot; release basic components fully compatible with 1.5.2 or not (xD) i hope so.. \n\nDont forget to create a shortcut for the minecraft launcher located in: AppDataRoaming.minecraftminecraft launcher\nTo change the language go to &quot;opciones&quot; and select &quot;idioma&quot;\n\nIf u find some other bugs and have the solution share it with the community :)\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c55060824fb77d41be3fc2917956849b848806","amp;dn":"Minecraft+%281.5.2%29+with+50+mods+%2B+more+UPDATED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c55060824fb77d41be3fc2917956849b848806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,197,80,96,130,79,183,125,65,190,63,194,145,121,86,132,155,132,136,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
