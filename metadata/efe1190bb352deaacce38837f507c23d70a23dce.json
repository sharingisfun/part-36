The former high school history teacher has just been released from a mental institution and placed in the care of his mother. Not one to be discouraged, Pat believes he has only been on the inside for a few monthsÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œrather than four yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œand plans on reconciling with his estranged wife.\nRefusing to accept that their apart time is actually a permanent separation, Pat spends his days and nights feverishly trying to become the man she had always desired. Our hapless hero makes a friend in Tiffany, the mentally unstable, widowed sister-in-law of his best friend, Ronnie.\n \n\nEach day as Pat heads out for his 10-mile run, Tiffany silently trails him, refusing to be shaken off by the object of her affection.\nThe odd pair try to navigate a timid friendship, but as Pat is unable to discern friend from foe and reality from deranged optimism, every day proves to be a cringe-worthy adventure. Pat is as sweet as a puppy, and his offbeat story has all the markings of a crowd-pleaser.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe1190bb352deaacce38837f507c23d70a23dce","amp;dn":"The+Silver+Linings+Playbook+-+Matthew+Quick+%28PDF%2FEPUB%2FMOBI%29+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe1190bb352deaacce38837f507c23d70a23dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,225,25,11,179,82,222,170,204,227,136,55,245,7,194,61,112,162,61,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
