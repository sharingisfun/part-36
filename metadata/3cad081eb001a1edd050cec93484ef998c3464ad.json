The single achieved this position in late 1961; it hit number one on the R&amp;B chart as well. &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; became a number-one hit again in early 1975 when The Carpenters' cover of the song reached the top position of the Billboard Hot 100.       \n     &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; is a 1962 song by Marvin Gaye. The single was successful enough to land Gaye his first top forty pop single in 1963 with &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; reaching number thirty on the pop singles chart while reaching number twelve on the R&amp;B singles chart.  The Velvet Underground's song &quot;There She Goes Again&quot; is based on &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;, as is the guitar intro to The Smiths' &quot;There is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot;. Another song which is likely based on &quot;Hitch-Hike&quot;, is &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; by The Beatles, especially the use of cowbell and congas and the pronounced stops at the end of each verse. Paul McCartney performed a live cover of the song during his 2011 performance at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan. \n     &quot;Don't Mess with Bill&quot; is a million-selling Gold certified 1966 single recorded by The Marvelettes. Written and produced by Smokey Robinson, &quot;Don't Mess with Bill&quot; features a lead vocal by Wanda Young. The single peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1966, and at number three on Billboard's R&amp;B singles chart. &quot;Don't Mess with Bill&quot; was the Marvelettes' final Top 10 single.\n     &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; is a 1965 pop single by Martha and the Vandellas and is one of the group's signature songs. The song, written and produced by Motown's main production team of HollandÃ¢â‚¬â€œDozierÃ¢â‚¬â€œHolland, depicts the story of a woman trapped in a bad relationship with a man she cannot help but love. Holand-Dozier-Holland and the Funk Brothers band gave the song a large, hard-driving instrumentation sound similar of the sound of prior &quot;Dancing In The Street&quot; with snow chains used as percussion alongside the tambourine and drums.  &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; hit number eight on the Billboard Pop Singles chart, and number five on the Billboard R&amp;B Singles chart. It also charted in the UK peaking at number twenty-six on the chart. This version was ranked #358 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cad081eb001a1edd050cec93484ef998c3464ad","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+420","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cad081eb001a1edd050cec93484ef998c3464ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,173,8,30,176,1,161,237,208,80,206,201,52,132,239,153,140,52,100,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
