Lady Soul provides her own piano accompaniment on the majority of tracks here, and the core band is the same one that provided the fire on her previous album. The tunes are an eclectic batch, and while &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; was the hit of the album, Franklin turns in strong versions of &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; &quot;Night Life,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nobody (Gonna Turn Me Around),&quot; and a quirky cover of &quot;96 Tears&quot; for good measure. An essential addition to her discography.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e282572e5a72c59ce26e42b7a5dcddcc173940d3","amp;dn":"Aretha+Franklin+-+Aretha+Arrives+%5B1967%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e282572e5a72c59ce26e42b7a5dcddcc173940d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,130,87,46,90,114,197,156,226,110,66,183,165,220,221,204,23,57,64,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
