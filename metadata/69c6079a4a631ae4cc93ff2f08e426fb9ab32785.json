As Trey told the story, Byrne threw Colonel Forbin off the mountain and into the arms of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“evilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Famous Mockingbird. The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was The Talking Heads' Remain in Light. All of the Remain in Light songs were Phish debuts; the set featured Karl Perazzo on percussion, Dave Grippo on saxophone, and Gary Gazaway on trumpet. Perazzo also played during the entire third set. Jesus Just Left Chicago, Suzy Greenberg, and Frankenstein also featured Grippo and Gazaway. At the end of Houses in Motion (which featured Trey teasing Tweezer), an armchair was brought out to the center of the stage and Mike sat in it to sing Seen and Not Seen. While he sang, Karl Perazzo drummed and Trey played bass. After Overload, a bizarre on-stage demonstration closed the set. The third set opened with a Feel Like a Stranger tease. Suzy included a Born Under Punches tease from Page. Simple included a tease of Mama Told Me Not to Come. The soundcheck's Overload was performed with horns and briefly featured Fishman on vacuum. This show was officially released as Live Phish 15.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c6079a4a631ae4cc93ff2f08e426fb9ab32785","amp;dn":"Phish+-+1996-10-31+-+The+Omni+%28LP15%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c6079a4a631ae4cc93ff2f08e426fb9ab32785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,198,7,154,74,99,26,228,204,147,255,47,8,228,38,251,154,179,39,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
