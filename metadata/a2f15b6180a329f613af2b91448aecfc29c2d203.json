The author presents a multitude of design techniques for improving the performances of analog signal processing circuits, and proposes specific implementation strategies that can be used in CMOS technology. The author's discussion proceeds from the perspective of signal processing as it relates to analog. Included are coverage of low-power design, portable equipment, wireless nano-sensors and medical implantable devices. The material is especially appropriate for researchers and specialists in the area of analog and mixed-signal CMOS VLSI design, as well as postgraduate or Ph.D. students working on analog microelectronics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f15b6180a329f613af2b91448aecfc29c2d203","amp;dn":"Synthesis+of+Computational+Structures+for+Analog+Signal+Processi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f15b6180a329f613af2b91448aecfc29c2d203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,241,91,97,128,163,41,246,19,175,43,145,68,138,236,252,41,194,210,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
