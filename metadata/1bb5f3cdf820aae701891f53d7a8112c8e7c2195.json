Goal was &quot;preview&quot; quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nFor example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set.\n\nContent:\n\nCraig.Ferguson.2010.05.03.Morgan.Freeman.H264[quark].mp4\nThe.Daily.Show.2010.05.03.Jonathan.Eig.H264[quark].mp4\nThe.Colbert.Report.2010.05.03.Elizabeth.Warren.H264[quark].mp4\n\n\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCompatible brands: JVT AVC\nCreation time: 3/05/2010 16:08:21 UTC\nModification time: 3/05/2010 16:08:21 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: audio (AAC Low complexity) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nVideo Codec: avc1\nResolution: 352 x 192\nDisplay aspect ratio: 341:192 = 1.776041 (~16:9)\nBitrate: 145.538225 kbps\nCodec: AAC Low complexity\nBitrate: 18.245430 kbps\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 22050 Hz\n\nDownload whole package or just ones you want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bb5f3cdf820aae701891f53d7a8112c8e7c2195","amp;dn":"Talk.Shows.Pack.2010.03.05%28Craig.The.Daily.Colbert%29.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bb5f3cdf820aae701891f53d7a8112c8e7c2195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,181,243,205,248,32,170,231,1,137,31,83,215,168,17,44,142,124,33,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
