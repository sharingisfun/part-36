Wanted to share it here for those that were disappointed with season 6 of LOST and would like to see this fanedit that makes the ending totally different. This is the FIRST of FOUR parts and if I see an interest in this I will post the next ones:)\n\nHere's the original release info:\nThis is a Fan Edit.

Yes\n\nBrief Synopsis:\nIn this 4-Part fan edit of LOSTÃƒâ€ s final season, we discover what happens to the\nsurvivors of Oceanic 815 after they detonated the hydrogen bomb 30 years in the\npast in order to change the future. This fan edit ends with a much different\noutcome than the series did.\n\nIntention:\nThis miniseries is meant to be watched after the first five seasons of LOST. I\nwanted to give LOST fans like myself a better ending to the show.\n\nThis is the final version of this edit.\n\nLike most avid LOST fans, I was disappointed by Season 6, not only because they\nwasted so much time throughout the season, but because the entire ÃƒÂ´flash-\nsidewaysÃƒÂ¶ world was a red-herring. We werenÃƒâ€ t flashing into an alternate\nuniverse at all, but rather a time many years in the future where all the\ncharacters were dead and trying to find each other in an elaborate purgatory\nthey had created for themselves.\n\nThis show had always been about 2 things: the people and the island. I donÃƒâ€ t\nknow about you, but I really donÃƒâ€ t care what happens to the characters when they\ndie. Well, with this version, you wonÃƒâ€ t have to either. Inspired by the Prison\nBreak trilogy on the main site, this version completely removes the afterlife\nflashes from season six and turns it into a miniseries divided into 2-hour\nparts.\n\nCuts and Additions:\n\nThis one is a combination of the episodes &quot;LAX&quot; parts 1 and 2, &quot;What Kate Does&quot;\nand &quot;Across the Sea&quot; with no ÃƒÂ´flash-sidewaysÃƒÂ¶. Also, flashbacks tell the details\nof Jacob and the MiBÃƒâ€ s past. A few other trims were made here and there, but the\nstory mostly remains in tact for this part. Part 2 will have lots more cuts and\nre-arranging.\n\n- Added the scene from the Season 5 finale to the beginning with ÃƒÂ´FlockeÃƒÂ¶\nkilling Jacob. The end of this scene then goes to a flashback of their mother\narriving on the Island and giving birth to the twins. Then, to the LOST logo.\n- After the logo, we get a quick recap of the ÃƒÂ´LostiesÃƒÂ¶ dropping the bomb in the\nconstruction site, then we see what happened to them.\n- NO FLASH-SIDEWAYS!\n- Using the episode, ÃƒÂ´Across the Sea,ÃƒÂ¶ flashbacks are inserted throughout this\nedit explaining Jacob and MiBÃƒâ€ s past. The final scene of this part is Jacob\nlaying his mother and brother to rest in the caves, thus explaining the two\nbodies in the caves with the stones.\n- Cut a scene of Jack and Kate sharing a moment before she goes to look for\nSawyer. Mostly for pacing.\n- Cut Hurley and Miles over SayidÃƒâ€ s body saying goodbye.\n- Re-arranged some of the scenes so that the stuff with Ben and ÃƒÂ´FlockeÃƒÂ¶ on the\nbeach is spread out in this part. Rearranging some scenes also required the\nremoval of some dialogue.\n- Cut out all of the spots where it went to black on the commercial breaks.\n- Added ÃƒÂ´A Fan Edit by DriggyDriggsÃƒÂ¶ (my nick name) before the episode starts.\n- Added some credits where necessary due to cutting out the flash-sideways.\n\nThe following has been fixed for version 2:\n- Added titles before the bomb recap, ÃƒÂ´Thirty Years AgoÃƒÂ¶.\n- Created a new, slightly longer recap of the survivors dropping the nuclear\nbomb using footage from the Season 5 finale, ÃƒÂ´The Incident.ÃƒÂ¶\n- Added Guest Star credits for the actors from ÃƒÂ´Across the SeaÃƒÂ¶ and removed the\nGuest Stars that do not appear since the ÃƒÂ´flash-sidewaysÃƒÂ¶ was removed.\n- Added writer and director credits for ÃƒÂ´Across the SeaÃƒÂ¶ and ÃƒÂ´What Kate Does.ÃƒÂ¶\n- Increased the size of the text in the Scene Selection menu for the DVD.\n\nThe following has been fixed for version 3:\n- Removed episode opening for ÃƒÂ´What Kate DoesÃƒÂ¶ of The Interpreter running\nthrough the halls.\n- Added FanEdit.org animated logo to the end.\n\nSpecial Thanks:\nA special thanks goes out to Neglify for previewing my workprints and giving his\nfeedback. It is much appreciated!\n\nRelease Information:\n720p MKV ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9123b16621de8970bdfc4009dc1d28e46cf5f9d5","amp;dn":"LOST.The.Miniseries.Fanedit.2012.Part.1.Across.the.Sea.720p.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9123b16621de8970bdfc4009dc1d28e46cf5f9d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,35,177,102,33,222,137,112,189,252,64,9,220,29,40,228,108,245,249,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
