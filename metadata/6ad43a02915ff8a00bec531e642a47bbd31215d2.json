It was first published by Eternity Comics and ran nine issues until 1990 when it was cancelled. The title once again returned to publication in a revamped version in 1993 by Malibu Comics, which Eternity had become an imprint of.\n\nDinosaurs For Hire, along with Ex-Mutants, was merged with the Protectors universe during Malibu's Genesis crossover before being cancelled a second time. While Malibu was purchased by Marvel Comics in 1993, it is unclear whether or not Dinosaurs for Hire was part of that purchase.\n\nDinosaurs For Hire is a satirical comic that is heavy on parody and humor. The primary characters are a T-Rex named Archie who dresses like the Terminator, a Triceratops named Lorenzo who wears a Hawaiian shirt, a one-eyed Stegosaurus named Reese who wields heavy weapons and a pterodactyl named Cyrano. In the comics, the Dinosaurs are mercenaries for hire and exist in the 20th century.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7990157/Dinosaurs_for_Hire_v1__1-9___Fall_Classic_(1988-1990)_[Eternity]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7990157/Dinosaurs_for_Hire_v1__1-9___Fall_Classic_(1988-1990)_[Eternity]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ad43a02915ff8a00bec531e642a47bbd31215d2","amp;dn":"Dinosaurs+for+Hire+v2+%231-12+%281993-1994%29+%5BMalibu%5D+%28Requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ad43a02915ff8a00bec531e642a47bbd31215d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,212,58,2,145,95,248,160,11,236,83,30,100,42,71,187,211,18,21,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
