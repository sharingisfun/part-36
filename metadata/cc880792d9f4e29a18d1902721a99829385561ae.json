The Culper spies represent all the patriotic Americans who give so much for their country but, because of the nature of their work, will not or cannot take a bow or even talk about their missions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Brian Kilmeade\n\nWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington ralliedÃ¢â‚¬â€thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\n\nWashington realized that he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ identities that one spyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\n\nDrawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret six:\n\n?Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\n\n?Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\n\n?Caleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\n\n?Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\n\n?James Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\n\n?Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\n\nIn George WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc880792d9f4e29a18d1902721a99829385561ae","amp;dn":"George+Washington%27s+Secret+Six+-+Brian+Kilmeade.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc880792d9f4e29a18d1902721a99829385561ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,136,7,146,217,244,226,154,24,209,144,39,33,169,152,41,56,85,97,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
