McLaglen and screenwriter James Lee Barrett team up with actor James Stewart for this Western about a band of ex-convicts trying to go straight. Stewart stars as Mattie Appleyard, the leader of the group. After serving his time, Mattie retrieves a 25,000-dollar check from a banker who looked after his funds while he was in prison. Along with his two pals, Mattie intends to use the money to open up a general store and make a fresh start. Unfortunately for them, the banker and a former jailer both look to stand in the way of their dreams. George Kennedy, who also had roles in Shenandoah and Bandolero!, co-stars as Dock Council, the former prison official, and a young Kurt Russell appears in one of his first non-Disney films.\n\nRipped from a DVD of a Rip from a TCM cable broadcast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c0230d95c01d54e4df3cf2488d9deeba4c5260f","amp;dn":"Fools%27+Parade+%281971%29+x264+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c0230d95c01d54e4df3cf2488d9deeba4c5260f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,2,48,217,92,1,213,78,77,243,207,36,136,217,222,235,164,197,38,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
