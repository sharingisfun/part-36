He grows into a talented and powerful young dancer, making a cultural exchange visit to the Houston ballet, where the artistic director Ben Stevenson (Bruce Greenwod) recognizes his potential. The student soon becomes a star, and he discovers that America is not the dark, downtrodden place that was the propaganda dealt out by the party in his village school. Despite his concerns for the safety of his family, he decides he should stay in America ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but the Chinese Government doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t agree.\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/maos-last-dancer/international-trailer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/maos-last-dancer/international-trailer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB.URL.......: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1071812/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1071812/&lt;/a&gt;\nMOVIE.NAME.....: Mao's Last Dancer              \nGENRE..........: Drama                            \nMOVIE.YEAR.....: 2009                          \nTHEATRE/STV....: THEATRE                  \nIMDB.RATING....: 7.7/10   401 votes              \nX264.RELEASE...: 7 March 2010                \nDVD.RELEASE....:                                    \nLANGUAGES......: English    \nSUBTITLES......: English          \nRESOLUTION.....: 1920x1040                        \nASPECT.RATIO...: 1.85:1            \nVIDEO.BITRATE..: 8168 Kpbs        \nAUDIO.SPECS....: DTS @ 1509Kbps          \nRUNTIME........: 118 minutes                    \nX264.SIZE......: 8133MB                      \nFILENAME.......: wthd-mld1080p.mkv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325bab915ddc8610db1dbf710988c7c3a03f2c06","amp;dn":"Maos+Last+Dancer+2009+1080p+BluRay+x264-TheWretched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325bab915ddc8610db1dbf710988c7c3a03f2c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,91,171,145,93,220,134,16,219,29,191,113,9,136,199,195,160,63,44,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
