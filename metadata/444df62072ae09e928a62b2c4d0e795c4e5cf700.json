I think there was only one printing of the original paperback, which accounts for the steep prices as it has become a cult favorite. I do not want to spoil anything but will warn you the book is far darker than the toned down TV movie. Ronald is really really bad!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444df62072ae09e928a62b2c4d0e795c4e5cf700","amp;dn":"Bad+Ronald+by+Jack+Vance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444df62072ae09e928a62b2c4d0e795c4e5cf700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,77,246,32,114,174,9,233,40,166,43,44,77,14,121,92,78,92,247,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
