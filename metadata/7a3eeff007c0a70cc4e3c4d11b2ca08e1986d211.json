He retired from clerical service after discovering that his participation in the Salem Witch Trials had resulted in the executions of only innocent people, while true evil lurked not in people, but as manifestations of nature. He encounters the Queen of Thorns, a demon witch that takes the form of a gnarled, splintering dead tree.\n\nenjoy\n\nhappy new year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3eeff007c0a70cc4e3c4d11b2ca08e1986d211","amp;dn":"Salem+-+Queen+Of+Thorns+%282008%29cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3eeff007c0a70cc4e3c4d11b2ca08e1986d211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,62,239,240,7,192,167,12,196,227,196,209,27,44,160,142,25,134,210,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
