That's the case with this invaluable, two-CD collection that captures clarinetist Benny Goodman's historic 1938 Carnegie Hall concert, which exemplified the so-called &quot;swing era.&quot; Originally released in 1950, it contains rare commentary from Goodman and music from the entire event, which was a unique mix of formality and spontaneity. Goodman's perfect intonation and lyrical improvisation front the big band here, featuring the smooth solos of trumpeter Harry James, the percussive power of Gene Krupa--jumping the blues on &quot;Don't Be That Way&quot;--and the Fletcher Henderson- arranged &quot;Sometimes I'm Happy&quot; and &quot;One O'Clock Jump.&quot; Another segment of the evening, called &quot;Twenty Years of Jazz,&quot; takes Goodman to New Orleans with a lickety-split reading of &quot;Sensation Rag&quot; and &quot;When My Baby Smiles at Me.&quot; A spirited jam session follows with Count Basie on the keys, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophonists Johnny Hodges, Lester Young, and Harry Carney, along with trumpeter Buck Clayton. Goodman hangs tough with the crew on a rollicking read of Fats Waller's &quot;Honeysuckle Rose.&quot; The spotlight turns to Goodman's color-line breaking small combos. His trio with Krupa and the elegant, fleet-fingered Teddy Wilson on piano delivers a harmonically delicious version of &quot;Body &amp; Soul&quot; that would give Coleman Hawkins's version a run for its money. When vibraphonist Lionel Hampton gets into the mix and makes it a quartet, the standards &quot;Avalon,&quot; &quot;The Man I Love,&quot; and &quot;I Got Rhythm,&quot; as well as &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy,&quot; are transformed into timeless vehicles of improvisation. The big band returns with growling grandeur on Irving Berlin's optimistic &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and the British Isle balladry of &quot;Loch Lomond,&quot; with the majestic vocals of Martha Tilton. One listen to Goodman and company's rockhouse romp on &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; will testify to the success of this event, which still reverberates today. --Eugene Holley Jr.\n\nAll Music Review by Bruce Eder - Benny Goodman's January 16, 1938, Carnegie Hall concert is considered the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's &quot;coming out&quot; party to the world of &quot;respectable&quot; music, held right in that throne room of musical respectability, Carnegie Hall. The 1950-vintage three-album set from the concert only solidified its reputation, and an earlier CD release derived from the LP master was a choice entry in the Goodman catalog for more than ten years. For the 1999 release, producer Phil Schaap re-sourced the concert from original 78 rpm transcription discs; he has also rescued &quot;Sometimes I'm Happy,&quot; the show's original second number, and &quot;If Dreams Come True,&quot; its original first encore, along with the unedited version of &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; (with Harry Carney in a two-chorus baritone sax solo and Buck Clayton's three-chorus trumpet solo), all previously lost. The detail is startling, with soloists who are more up close than ever and even details from the audience reactions. Gene Krupa's drums have an extraordinary richness of tone, and the whole rhythm section finally gets its due as well, even Freddie Green's rhythm guitar solo during &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; which is gloriously enhanced. There will be casual listeners, however, who won't like this release because Schaap has chosen to leave a lot of surface noise, in the interest of preserving the original concert ambience. Some compromise should have been possible, however, where the worst source damage is concerned, and some casual listeners may prefer the original CD release, despite the enhancements featured here..\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Benny Goodman 1950 Introduction\n[02] Don't Be That Way\n[03] Sometimes I'm Happy\n[04] One O'Clock Jump\n[05] Applause, Transition To 20 Years Of Jazz\n[06] Sensation Rag\n[07] I'm Coming Virginia\n[08] When My Baby Smiles At Me\n[09] Shine\n[10] Blue Reverie\n[11] Applause, Transition Back To Goodman\n[12] Life Goes To A Party\n[13] Setting Up For Jam Session\n[14] Honeysuckle Rose\n[15] Applause, Setting Up For BG Small Groups\n[16] Body And Soul\n[17] Applause, Enter Lionel Hampton\n[18] Avalon\n[19] The Man I Love\n[20] I Got Rhythm\n[21] Pause Track\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:04m:24s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Blue Skies\n[02] Loch Lomond\n[03] Applause, &quot;No Encore&quot; Annoucement\n[04] Blue Room\n[05] Swingtime In The Rockies\n[06] Applause, Martha Tilton Returns To Stage\n[07] Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen\n[08] Applause, Setting Up For BG Small Groups\n[09] China Boy\n[10] Stompin' At The Savoy\n[11] Applause, BG Quartet Contiues But Changes Program\n[12] Dizzy Spells\n[13] Applause, Transition Back To Goodman For Finale\n[14] Sing Sing Sing (With A Swing)\n[15] Applause Until Encores\n[16] If Dreams Come True\n[17] Applause For Second Encore\n[18] Big John's Special\n[19] Pause Track\n[20] Introduction\n[21] Don't Be That Way\n[22] Twenty Years Of Jazz\n[23] Blue Reverie\n[24] Life Goes To A Party\n[25] Body And Soul\n[26] Avalon\n[27] Swingtime In The Rockies\n[28] Conclusion\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:58m:13s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 02h:02m:37s\nTotal File Size....................... 448mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
