The hero(ine) is actually called The Black Whip throughout.\nThe serial is set in pre-statehood Idaho, and involves a fight to prevent and ensure statehood by the villains and heroes respectively.\n\nParts of this serial were reused as stock footage to pad out later serials such as Don Daredevil Rides Again (1951) and Man with the Steel Whip (1954) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ despite the fact that both of those serials had male leads.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Linda Stirling as Barbara Meredith, The Black Whip and newspaper proprietrix\n    George J. Lewis as Vic Gordon, a US government agent allied with the Black \n     Whip. \n    Lucien Littlefield as &quot;Tenpoint&quot; Jackson, the comic relief newspaper \n     typesetter working with Barbara Meredith\n    Francis McDonald as Dan Hammond, villainous owner of the town's Stagecoach \n     company\n    Hal Taliaferro as Baxter, one of Hammond's henchmen\n    John Merton as Ed Harris, one of Hammond's henchmen\n    Stanley Price as Hedges, Hammond's Clerk-Henchman\n\nThe surnames of the two lead characters, Meredith and Gordon, are an in-joke referencing two earlier Republic serials.\nThe character Nyoka the Jungle Girl and her father had the surname Meredith in Jungle Girl, but their last name was Gordon in the semi-sequel Perils of Nyoka.\n\n    CHAPTERS:-\n    01. The Masked Avenger \n    02. Tomb of Terror \n    03. Mob Murder \n    04. Detour to Death \n    05. Take Off That Mask!\n    06. Fatal Gold \n    07. Wolf Pack \n    08.

Trial of Tyranny \n\nThis serial was put into production, with Linda Stirling as the main star, following the actress' popular performance in The Tiger Woman.\nZorro's Black Whip was budgeted at $134,899 although the final negative cost was $145,251 (a $10,352, or 7.7%, overspend). \nIt was the cheapest Republic serial of 1944. It was filmed between 29 July and 26 August 1944 under the working title The Black Whip.\nThe serial's production number was 1495. Despite physically wrestling with her, the villains never realize that the very obviously female Black Whip is a woman.\nFootage from this serial was reused in Don Daredevil Rides Again and Man with the Steel Whip.\n\nThis was one of two 12-chapter serials released in 1944, along with Linda Stirling's serial debut, The Tiger Woman. It had been Republic's standard pattern to produce two 12-chapter serials and two 15-chapter serials each year since 1938 but 1944 was the last year that occurred. In fact, Republic would only produce two more 15-chapter serials, Manhunt of Mystery Island and The Purple Monster Strikes, both in 1945 and both starring Linda Stirling.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Zorro's Black Whip (1944)\nHammond, owner of the town's stagecoach line and a leading citizen, is opposed to Idaho becoming a state, and kills Randolph Meredith, owner of the town's newspaper, for endorsing it. Meredith's sister Barbara, expert with a bullwhip and pistol, dons a black costume and mask and becomes &quot;The Black Whip&quot;, dealing a blow to Hammond and his gang each time they perform some heinous act in their efforts to keep the town, and their power over it, unchanged. Aided by government agent Vic Gordon, Barbara confronts Hammond in a final showdown just as the town votes on whether or not to accept statehood. \n\nIn Zorro's Black Whip the word Zorro never occurs, but a female who behaves like Don Diego in Idaho fights a cabal of corrupt politicians as &quot;The Black Whip&quot; after her brother (the original Black Whip) is killed.\n\nHammond, owner of the town's stagecoach line and a leading citizen on the council, is secretly opposed to Idaho becoming a stateÃ¢â‚¬â€because government protection would destroy the system and organization he has constructedÃ¢â‚¬â€and conducts raids against citizens and settlers alike to prevent order, while keeping his own identity as the organization's leader secret. The town marshal is meanwhile powerless to act outside his jurisdiction beyond the town boundary. Randolph Meredith, owner of the town's newspaper, as the Black Whip, opposes this scheme to defeat statehood, but one day he is killed after preventing yet another coup. Meredith's sister Barbara, expert with a bullwhip and pistol, dons Randolph's black costume and mask and becomes &quot;The Black Whip&quot; in her brother's place, dealing a blow to Hammond and his gang each time they perform some heinous act in their efforts to keep the town, and their power over it, unchanged.\n\nAided by recently arrived undercover US government agent Vic Gordon, Barbara (Linda Stirling) as The Black Whip is quite obviously female but, even after a bout of wrestling, the villains do not realise they aren't fighting a man. Some reference is made to this in the script, however, when the villains are trying to determine who the Black Whip's secret identity could be:\n\n    Hammond: Barbara Meredith, she's the Black Whip! Baxter: She couldn't be! The Black Whip's got to be a man! He's outshot us, outrode us, and outfought us, stopped us at every turn!\n  \nCHAPTER NINE - The Avalanche\nHammond orders her taken, but the day is saved when Vic Gordon discovers Barbara's secret and removes her from suspicion by appearing in her costume and overcoming her captors. From this point on, despite relinquishing the costume at her insistence that she must continue as the Black Whip, he tends to assume the hero role while Barbara becomes slightly more of a traditional damsel in distress, even while she still holds her own in successive violent confrontations with Hammond's henchmen, and more than once saves Vic's life.\n\nAfter the town has finally voted on whether or not to accept statehood, most of Hammond's gang are gunned down while attempting to steal the ballot boxes. Hammond escapes, and secretly trails and confronts Barbara in her cave when she removes her mask. He takes aim, but is struck down by the Black Whip's stallion. The reign of terror has ended. Vic remains with Barbara and the marshall to help maintain peace in the territory.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 182 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 182 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f31453fae3219f96f8a86c879b31e282a1c00414","amp;dn":"Zorro%27s+Black+Whip+%281944%29+DVD9+-+Western+Theatrical+Serial+-+12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f31453fae3219f96f8a86c879b31e282a1c00414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,20,83,250,227,33,159,150,248,168,108,135,155,49,226,130,161,192,4,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
