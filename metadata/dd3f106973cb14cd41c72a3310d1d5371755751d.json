Re-mastering's a really amazing thing. That was the musical point of it all, because there's so much there that you wouldn't have heard before. It was like discovering stuff, because the advances in mastering are so immense since the last time [the Clash catalogue] was remastered in the 90s.&quot;\n\nAll the music has been remastered from the original tapes, Jones said. &quot;We had to bake the tapes beforehand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the oxide on them is where the music is, so if you don't put them in the oven and bake them, that all falls off, because they're so old.&quot;\n\n&quot;I couldn't believe how much information was missing from our last batch of CDs [in 1999],&quot; The Clash's Mick Jones told me upon the release of the 2013 CD box set Sound System ... which were also released in killer high-resolution HDtracks versions. If you like it raw, wild, and always probing for the new direction, pick up any one of The Clash's albums. London Calling, Sandinista!, and Combat Rock still sound as though they were recorded tomorrow. &quot;This is it. This is the final word, in my opinion,&quot; the band's bassist Paul Simonon said, putting it perfectly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd3f106973cb14cd41c72a3310d1d5371755751d","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+Combat+Rock+%281982%29+-+2013+Sound+System+re-master+301","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd3f106973cb14cd41c72a3310d1d5371755751d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,63,16,105,115,203,20,205,65,199,42,51,16,209,213,55,23,85,117,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
