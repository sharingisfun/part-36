Dixson\n Publisher: O U P 2009 | 232 Pages | ISBN: 0199559422 , 0199559430 | PDF | 2.23 MB\n\n\n\n Comparative analyses of the anatomy, reproductive physiology, and behaviour of extant primates and other mammals can offer important insights into the origins of human sexual behaviour, allowing us to reconstruct the origins of human mating systems, the evolution of sexual attractiveness, patterns of mate choice, and copulatory behaviour. \n\n Sexual Selection and the Origins of Human Mating Systems provides a modern synthesis of research on the evolution of human mating systems, bringing together work on reproductive physiology, behavioural biology, anthropology, primatology, palaeontology, evolutionary psychology, and sexological research. The approach taken is genuinely cross-disciplinary in scope, and provides a fascinating account of the effects of sexual selection upon human evolution in the light of the latest advances in the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee5d4394aadffc18f77d1852ff1e51f2792a839e","amp;dn":"Sexual+Selection+and+the+Origins+of+Human+Mating+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee5d4394aadffc18f77d1852ff1e51f2792a839e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,93,67,148,170,223,252,24,247,125,24,82,255,30,81,242,121,42,131,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
