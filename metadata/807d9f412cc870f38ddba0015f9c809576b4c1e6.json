Once in boot camp, wiseguy John tangles with his by-the-book Sgt. and becomes the unofficial leader for his platoon, made up mostly of other misfits and assorted losers. After somehow making it through graduation, they are given a special assignment but, thanks to John's romantic interest in a pretty MPO, the other men wind up behind the Iron Curtain until John, Russell, their dates and Sgt. Hulka make a daring rescue attempt in explosive style. \n\n\n\nFile Name: Stripes 1981.avi\nFile Size: 700 MB\n\n[Container]\nFormat: AVI  (AVI format)\nDuration: 01:46:08.36\nBit Rate: 923 kbps\n\n[Video]\nCodec: MPEG4  (MPEG-4 part 2)\nCodec Tag: XVID (0x44495658)\nPicture Size: 608x336  (PAR 1:1, DAR 38:21)\nFrame Rate: 23.98 fps\nBit Rate: 811 kbps\n\n[Audio]\nCodec: MP3  (MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3))\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nSample Data Format: 16 bits (Integer)\nBit Rate: 112 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:807d9f412cc870f38ddba0015f9c809576b4c1e6","amp;dn":"Stripes+1981+%5BMissouriMike%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"807d9f412cc870f38ddba0015f9c809576b4c1e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,125,159,65,44,200,112,243,141,219,160,1,95,156,128,149,118,180,193,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
