These are all their releases so far, only the cover is ripped, the rest is original. Their debut-album is out due in September, these are pre-releases from the limited 7&quot; vinyls.\n\nfiN is an English band hailing from London that survives by word-of-mouth as they are not signed to any label. Please have a listen, you will not regret it! \n\nOfficial website: www.lifeiswastedontheliving.com\n\nIf you enjoy the songs, check out the webshop for their cheap 7&quot; vinyl releases and support the band by spreading the word. They perform quite a lot throughout the UK and have supported Mona, Feeder and Incubus in Europe. They are brilliant live and have been compared to bands like Muse, Smashing Pumpkins and dEUs.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94aa335a242f6bcadf7088b4aacd20100c51c7cb","amp;dn":"fiN+-+New+indie%2C+progressive+rock+band.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94aa335a242f6bcadf7088b4aacd20100c51c7cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,170,51,90,36,47,107,202,223,112,136,180,170,205,32,16,12,81,199,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
