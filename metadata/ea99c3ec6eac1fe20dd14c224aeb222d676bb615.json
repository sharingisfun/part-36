For (or maybe I should spell it as &quot;four&quot;) this 1996 CD they bring back Chief Bey, Mor Thiam, and Mar Gueye.  &quot;They&quot; are not the same saxophonists as the earlier CD - the WSQ is David Murray, Hamiett Bluiett, Oliver Lake, and John Purcell.  The opener, &quot;Dou Dou N'Daiye Rose&quot;, feels like a neighborhood stroll with some great saxophonists.  This song was written by Mar Gueye, and two others were written by Mor Thiam, which points to the collaborative nature of the CD.  &quot;Dakar Darkness&quot; starts more slowly, but is a slower song with an unspooling melody.  There's a middle section with a poem recited by Oliver Lake.  The poem works very well with the music.  &quot;Suga&quot; has call-and-response vocals integrated with the music.  It's a Mor Thiam composition, and I figure the percussionists are singing because I don't understand the words.  &quot;Colors&quot; is a slow blues burn.  &quot;For Now&quot; is a very loose, free song.  &quot;What A Dream&quot;, as its title implies, has a hummable melody, and plenty of WSQ-style group improv.  &quot;Sangara&quot; closes the CD with a poppy-sounding propulsive beat and vocal chant from the percussionists (as well as more saxophone).  \n\nI've read one critic say that &quot;Four Now&quot; is better than &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; because the African drummers are better worked into the music.  I don't agree with either part of that evaluation - I like &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; a little better, and think the percussion is just fine.  Regardless, if you like the W. S. Q. , or &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, or want to try something new out, &quot;Four Now&quot; is a fine CD to have.  ~ Anthony Cooper\n\nIt surprises me that this date from WSQ has not yet been commented upon.  It's a solid outing, one which includes Mor Thiam and other legendary African drummers.  Also noteworythy is Oliver Lake's poetry on &quot;Dakar Darkness,&quot; which was written by David Murray.  David's bass clarinet playing on that tune is elegant and powerful.  Strongly recommended.  ~ Rob Hoff\n\nPersonnel:\nDavid Murray - Clarinet (Bass), Sax (Tenor)\nHamiet Bluiett - Sax (Baritone), Contra-Alto Clarinet\nJohn Purcell - Flute (Alto), Saxophone, Saxello, Flute, English Horn\nOliver Lake - Sax (Alto), Talking\nChief Bey - Vocals, African Drums\nMar Gueye - Vocals, African Drums\nMor Thiam - Vocals, African Drums\n\nWorld Saxophone Quartet - Four Now Track Listings:\n01  Dou Dou NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Daiye Rose\n02  Dakar Darkness\n03  Suga\n04  Colors\n05  For Now\n06  What a Dream\n07  Sangara\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea99c3ec6eac1fe20dd14c224aeb222d676bb615","amp;dn":"World+Saxophone+Quartet+-+Four+Now+%281996%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea99c3ec6eac1fe20dd14c224aeb222d676bb615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,153,195,236,110,172,31,226,13,209,76,34,74,235,34,45,103,107,182,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
