During the past decade there has been an increasing interest in the role that sport and physical activity can play in the treatment of mental health problems, and in mental health promotion. The benefits resulting from physiological changes during exercise are well documented, including improvement in mood and control of anxiety and depression. Research also suggests that socio-cultural and psychological changes arising from engagement in sport and physical activity carry valuable mental health benefits.\n\nSport and Physical Activity for Mental Health is an evidence-based practical guide for nurses, allied health professionals, social workers, physical activity leaders, and sport coaches. The authors provide comprehensive analysis of a broad range of client narratives, integrating theory and the latest research to explore the effectiveness of various interventions. The book offers readers detailed recommendations, suggestions, and ideas as to how sport and physical activity opportunities can be tailored to provide the greatest mental health benefits....................................\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cc46c9d40663eb7250c0fb0dd0c32f39306d71f","amp;dn":"Sport+and+Physical+Activity+for+Mental+Health-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cc46c9d40663eb7250c0fb0dd0c32f39306d71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,196,108,157,64,102,62,183,37,12,15,176,221,12,50,243,147,6,215,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
