Although many of the publications related to primitive art are beautiful and a pleasure to look at, they often do some injustice by oversimplification. Identifications of objects and explanations of their ritual use and meaning do not make clear the importance of art in a tribal society. This anthology includes representative and meaningful writings that are concerned with these problems, and the chronological arrangement of the essays in this volume shows to some degree the development of theory pertaining to primitive art since 1950","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c95ad30fe59bce09134b17cf487871594f3fac2","amp;dn":"Art+and+Aesthetics+in+primitive+societies+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c95ad30fe59bce09134b17cf487871594f3fac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,149,173,48,254,89,188,224,145,52,177,124,244,135,135,21,148,243,250,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
