His work Die Vermessung der Welt (translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway as Measuring the World, 2006) is the best selling novel in the German language since Patrick SÃƒÂ¼skind's Perfume was released in 1985. Kehlmann's works, and in particular Die Vermessung der Welt, are heavily influenced by magical realism and represent a dramatic shift from the goals of the influential Group 47.\n\nHe was awarded the Heimito von Doderer Prize for the novel. Kehlmann was born in Munich, the son of the television director Michael Kehlmann. He moved to his father's hometown of Vienna at the age of six. At university he read philosophy and literature before doing research for a doctoral thesis on the sublime in the works of Immanuel Kant which he did not finish partly because of his success as a writer.\n\nIn 1997 Kehlmann completed his first novel, Beerholms Vorstellung, while still a student. He also wrote numerous reviews and essays while at university, contributing to such organs as: SÃƒÂ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and Literaturen.\n\nIn 2001, Kehlmann held the guest lectureship of poetics at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. In the winter term of 2005/6 Kehlmann held the lectureship of poetics at the FH Wiesbaden, and in 2006/7 he held the lectureship for poetics at the university of GÃƒÂ¶ttingen. Daniel Kehlmann is a member of the Mainzer Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur.\n\n\n\nThe torrent contains:\n\n* Fame -  A Novel in Nine Episodes, 2009 -- ePUB\n\n* Me and Kaminski, 2003 -- ePUB\n\n* Measuring the World, 2005 -- ePUB\n\n\n\nRead the articles, interview, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give feedback!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kehlmann&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kehlmann&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/19/books.germany&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/19/books.germany&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/19/daniel-kehlmann-fame-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/19/daniel-kehlmann-fame-interview&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea34ced0f408e8f47c4f149123008e531fe2c228","amp;dn":"Daniel+Kehlmann+-+3+Novels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea34ced0f408e8f47c4f149123008e531fe2c228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,52,206,208,244,8,232,244,124,79,20,145,35,0,142,83,31,226,194,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
