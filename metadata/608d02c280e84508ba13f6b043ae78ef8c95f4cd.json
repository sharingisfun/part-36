This CD features arrangements that take full advantage of that talent.  In addition, Sarah Vaughan possesed a quality in her voice that makes it, although not the musicians behind that voice, sound as if these recordings could have been done last year.  She was truly one of the great female singers in not only jazz, but in American History. ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 42 - Sarah Vaughan Tracks:\n01  I Cried For You 2:17 \n02  I Feel Pretty 2:24\n03  Words Can't Describe 4:30\n04  Pennies From Heaven 3:03\n05  It's Got To Be Love 2:25 \n06  Dancing In The Dark 3:43 \n07  Doodlin' 4:32\n08  Prelude To A Kiss 2:44\n09  Polka Dots And Moonbeams 2:31 \n10  The More I See You 5:15 \n11  I Left My Heart In San Francisco 4:07 \n12  Like Someone In Love 3:03\n13  Body And Soul 3:10 \n14  Over The Rainbow 5:13\n15  Misty 5:59\n16  Tenderly 2:29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:608d02c280e84508ba13f6b043ae78ef8c95f4cd","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+42+-+Sarah+Vaughan+%281995%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+224-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"608d02c280e84508ba13f6b043ae78ef8c95f4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,141,2,194,128,232,69,8,186,19,246,176,67,174,120,239,140,149,244,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
