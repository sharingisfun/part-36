The melodic hard rock band consists of guitarist Mike         |\n|  Ransom, guitarist Tim Fluckey, bassist Dave DeRoo, drummer Kris Kohls,    |\n|  and singer Mark Chavez, the younger half-brother of Korn&amp;#039;s Jonathan       |\n|  Davis. Adema consists of former members of Bakersfield bands Juice and    |\n|  SexArt, which included Davis and Ryan Shuck of Orgy. The lineup had been  |\n|  together for a year before ever performing live. The demos they wrote in  |\n|  that time secured them a deal with Arista after a major-label bidding     |\n|  war, created undoubtedly because of Chavez&amp;#039;s family lineage. Their debut  |\n|  self-titled album was written in a northern California cabin where tight  |\n|  quarters and a little cabin fever resulted in productive (and slightly    |\n|  aggressive) sessions. Adema recorded the album in Los Angeles with        |\n|  producers Bill Appleberry (7th House) and Tobias Miller (Wallflowers      |\n|  guitarist). Adema was released in August 2001 and was considered by the   |\n|  music industry to be a test of hitmaker and new Arista president Antonio  |\n|  Reid&amp;#039;s ability to succeed outside of the R&amp;B genre. That success led to   |\n|  a coveted main stage spot on the Ozzfest tour and certified gold record   |\n|  the following year. Adema released a six-song EP, Insomniac&amp;#039;s Dream,      |\n|  before unleashing their full-length follow-up, the Howard Benson-         |\n|  produced Unstable in 2003. The album was a success, but the collapse of   |\n|  Arista left the group without a home, a problem soon remedied by the      |\n|  indie label Earache. Besides losing support from a major, the band also   |\n|  lost guitarist Mike Ransom and lead singer Mark Chavez, who left the      |\n|  band to pursue other interests. After sifting through numerous other      |\n|  aspiring crooners, the group settled on fellow Southern Californian Luke  |\n|  Caraccioli and headed back into the studio, and the resulting Planets     |\n|  was released in April 2005. This particular lineup didn&amp;#039;t last long,      |\n|  however. Caraccioli quit the band soon after the album came out, though   |\n|  he was replaced the following year by Bobby Reeves, who had previously    |\n|  sung in the L.A. band LEVEL, bringing along with him guitarist Ed Faris.  |\n|  Signed to Immortal Records, Adema issued Kill the Headlights in summer    |\n|  2007.                                                                     |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nvisit: http://www.xplicitbootlegs.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385e97fcb646fbed31daeab3c1b6dea059ea17ff","amp;dn":"Adema-Kill_The_Headlights-%28Advance%29-2007-FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385e97fcb646fbed31daeab3c1b6dea059ea17ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,94,151,252,182,70,251,237,49,218,234,179,193,182,222,160,89,234,23,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
