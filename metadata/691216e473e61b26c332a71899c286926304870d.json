Before building a park, the player needs to study the\n mountain topography and terrain. Therefore, it was imperative to allow the\n player complete freedom of camera movement. Building lifts and slopes is as\n easy as drawing lines on the ground. Skiers coming to the resort want to\n enjoy their stay so - apart from lifts and slopes - the player also needs to\n provide other infrastructure such as restaurants, ski patrols, snow cannons\n etc. This is where the economic simulation aspect of the game comes into\n play.\n\n Features:\n ~~~~~~~~~\n - classic tycoon gameplay\n - full 3D environment\n - explore your park in third person view\n - hundreds of skiers in one resort\n - 7 types of lifts\n - 12 types of buildings\n - campaign with 29 missions of various objectives\n - sandbox and unlimited game modes\n - 5 real world locations\n\n URL: http://www.skiparktycoon.com\n URL: http://www.desura.com/games/ski-park-tycoon\n\n                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                              \n - UnRAR\n - Burn/mount image with your favorite software\n - Install game\n\n                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                                                  \n Tired about all the self-made CD/DVD images made from download versions of\n the games? Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in\n the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion\n digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be\n noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes\n of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All\n old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R\n rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not\n active because of that).\n\n We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us\n or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care\n because we think that scene means that every game should be released.\n\n To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases\n both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene\n rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.\n\n                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                          \n    0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - DEFA - SMACKs    \n                             Razor1911 - RELOADED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691216e473e61b26c332a71899c286926304870d","amp;dn":"Ski_Park_Tycoon-FASiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691216e473e61b26c332a71899c286926304870d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,18,22,228,115,230,27,38,195,50,167,24,153,194,134,146,99,4,135,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
