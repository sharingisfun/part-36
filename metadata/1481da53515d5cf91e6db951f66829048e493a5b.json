This second edition builds strongly on the first, but it has been restructured, making the content more accessible and logically arranged. A valuable section on the Water Framework Directive has ben added, as has a closing chapter on &quot;Sustainable principles in water management&quot;\n\n&quot;This is an excellent book, covering the material at the correct level for student engineers and environmental scientists&quot; Professor P G Smith, Department of Civil Engineering, University of Paisley, UK\n\n&quot;Good basic text, covers all aspects of water treatment at required level.&quot; Dr Nancy Cromar, Department of Environmental Health, Flinders University, Australia\n\n&quot;Eminently readable&quot; Dr L R Davidson, Faculty of the Built Environment, UWE, UK\n\n&quot;Useful in covering the whole system.&quot; Dr A Lawrence, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Hull, UK\n\n&quot;...this mass of information is presented in simple and readable style ... Dr Gray's plain and lively style makes the subject less boring ... this is a good book, useful for anyone engaged in any aspect of water use. Whichever particular field one specialises in, it is a good idea to have guide to all the others. Sooner or later we all find ourselves out of our depth, and if the problem is not an industrial one, this is a book I would go to. If it didn't actually give me the answer, it would probably guid me to the next source&quot; George Solt in Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers Part B, March 2000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1481da53515d5cf91e6db951f66829048e493a5b","amp;dn":"Water+Technology%2C+Second+Edition%3A+An+Introduction+for+Environmen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1481da53515d5cf91e6db951f66829048e493a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,129,218,83,81,93,92,249,30,109,185,81,246,104,41,4,142,73,58,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
