Wissler Professor of Physics at Middlebury College. He did his undergraduate work at MIT and Swarthmore College, graduating from Swarthmore with a double major in physics and philosophy. He holds a master?s degree in environmental studies from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in physics from Dartmouth. Dr. Wolfson?s published work encompasses such diverse fields as medical physics, plasma physics, solar energy engineering, electronic circuit design, observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, nuclear issues, and climate change. His current research involves the eruptive behavior of the Sun?s outer atmosphere, or corona, as well as terrestrial climate change and the Sun-Earth connection.\nProfessor Wolfson is particularly interested in making science relevant to nonscientists and to students from all walks of academic life. His textbook, Physics for Scientists and Engineers (Addison Wesley, 1999), saw three editions and has been translated into several languages; it was followed by Essential University Physics (Addison Wesley, 2006). Dr. Wolfson?s books Nuclear Choices: A Citizen?s Guide to Nuclear Technology (MIT Press, 1993) and Simply Einstein: Relativity Demystified (W.W. Norton, 2003) exemplify his interest in making science understandable to nonscientists. His latest book, Energy, Environment, and Climate (W.W. Norton, 2007), is an undergraduate textbook accessible to general readers. He has also published in Scientific American and writes for World Book Encyclopedia. His previous courses for The Teaching Company include Einstein?s Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics for Nonscientists (1999) and Physics in Your Life (2004). Dr. Wolfson has spent sabbaticals at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado; at St. Andrews University in Scotland; and at Stanford University.\n\n\nLecture One.....
