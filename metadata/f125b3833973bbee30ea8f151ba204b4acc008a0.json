Each song averages to be around two and a half minutes long all while mixing in other tracks at the same time. The entire mix is kept at 128bpm (beats per minute) and took over 400 hours to produce from start to finish. Many songs did not make the final cut for reasons including; simply not the right sound, too long and unable to cut shorter, or simply didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give me a good gut feeling with the final tone of the mix. Everything is directly manipulated from a neighboring song either at the beginning or the end. MixMeister Fusion was the only application used in creating this mix.\n\nI created this mix for my Wedding on October 5th, 2013. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f125b3833973bbee30ea8f151ba204b4acc008a0","amp;dn":"Vintage+Red+-+Antique+Wedding+Power+Hour+Mega+Mix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f125b3833973bbee30ea8f151ba204b4acc008a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,37,179,131,57,115,187,238,48,234,143,21,27,162,4,180,172,192,8,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
