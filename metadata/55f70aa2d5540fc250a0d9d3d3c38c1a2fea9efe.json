These are vintage recordings, mostly from 1967, made by scholar-producer Pete Welding when Edwards was 51 years old. Edwards' itinerant lifestyle resulted in his missing many opportunities to record, so that this was only the fifth session he'd had in over 30 years in music, performing solo, with an acoustic guitar on eight of the 13 cuts here. Edwards cuts a daunting figure on the guitar, making the strings sing in several voices at once (check out the playing on 'Love Me Over Slow'), and his singing is a match for his playing. The eight solo numbers, dating from 1967, feature the music he was most familiar with, including Robert Johnson's 'Sweet Home Chicago' and the title track of this collection. The rest date from a March 1964 session on which Edwards shares the spotlight with singer-harpist John Lee Henley. As a bonus, the last track is an interview from his 1967 solo session in which Edwards talks about Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson, both of whom he knew personally. The background ambient sound does nothing to detract from the worth of the music, which has a wonderful raw quality.\n\n\nYou can tell these were done in one take.   Bum notes and fretboard buzz\nfly around like empty beer bottles in my place....(full-stop ellipsis)...\nbut it's still a classic.   And spot the blues guitarist (whom...nominative accusative) forgets what comes next and loses the plot.   I'm on vodka - -\ncan't you tell?\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f70aa2d5540fc250a0d9d3d3c38c1a2fea9efe","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+David+%5C%27Honeyboy%5C%27+Edwards+-+Crawling+Kingsnake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f70aa2d5540fc250a0d9d3d3c38c1a2fea9efe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,247,10,162,213,84,15,194,80,160,217,211,211,195,140,26,47,234,158,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
