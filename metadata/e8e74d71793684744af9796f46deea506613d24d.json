This new series, produced by Freeman's Revelations Entertainment, seeks the answers to the big questions: Are we alone? Where did we come from? Is there life on other planets? From the latest work at NASA and private enterprise facilities to the latest theories from academics and researchers, this series looks at black holes, colonizing the planets, string theory and more. Science Channel invites viewers on the journey as Morgan Freeman picks up where Carl Sagan's &quot;Cosmos&quot; left off and explores the new frontiers of what is beyond Earth. Through the Wormhole brings together the brightest minds and best ideas from the very edges of science - Astrophysics, Astrobiology, Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, and more - to reveal the extraordinary truth of our Universe.\n\n\n\n\n5)  What are we Really Made of \nWhat is the universe made of? If you answered stars, planets, gas and dust, you'd be dead wrong. Thirty years ago, scientists first realized that some unknown dark substance was affecting the way galaxies moved. Today, they think there must be five times our understanding of the universe and the nature of reality itself has drastically changed over the last 100 years - and it's on the verge of another seismic shift. In a 17-mile-long tunnel buried 570 feet beneath the Franco-Swiss border, the world's largest and most powerful atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider, is powering up. Its goal is nothing less than recreating the first instants of creation, when the universe was unimaginably hot and long-extinct forms of matter sizzled and cooled into stars, planets, and ultimately, us. These incredibly small and exotic particles hold the keys to the greatest mysteries of the universe. What we find could validate our long-held theories about how the world works and what we are made of -- or, all of our notions about the essence of what is real will fall apart.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/1584/throughthewormholebdrip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b2ffd3dbdcf2fe869c83&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2709 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16.9\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AC3 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 44mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container mkv\n * Part Size: average 851 MB\n * Source: BluRay DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Wormhole&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Wormhole&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e74d71793684744af9796f46deea506613d24d","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Through+the+Wormhole+5of8+What+are+we+Really+Made+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e74d71793684744af9796f46deea506613d24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,231,77,113,121,54,132,116,74,249,121,111,70,222,234,80,102,19,210,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
