This remuxing is focused on SD (approx. 400p) HDTV or Web-DL captures that have begun coming out as MKVs instead of MP4s, even though the audio and video streams inside those MKVs are standard/typical streams for MP4s.\r\n 2. The change to MKVs for these SD HDTV captures causes problems for many people and their devices (for no logical reason).\r\n 3. I will remux and share things I want to, I do not plan to be a comprehensive remux dumper of everything out there.\r\n 4. If you want to share such remuxes, add your own tag or feel free to use the same tag I am using making those of us who use the [mp4remuxer] tag only affiliated in that we are doing the same thing and it is a tag that makes the nature of these torrent very clear to all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a3ae93545d2f945ebcd985886ad64150a612f19","amp;dn":"Fear.the.Walking.Dead.S02E03.HDTV.x264-KILLERS%5Bmp4remuxer%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a3ae93545d2f945ebcd985886ad64150a612f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,58,233,53,69,210,249,69,235,205,152,88,134,173,100,21,10,97,47,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
