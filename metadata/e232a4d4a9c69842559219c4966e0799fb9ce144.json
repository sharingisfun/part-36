In the opening scene, he's committing rape, and before the credits even roll, he's also stolen a car to flee from Manchester to the London home of an old girlfriend (Lesley Sharp). The film's loose, sprawling narrative follows Johnny as he randomly makes his way through the streets of London, encountering a homeless Scottish couple, a nightwatchman and a series of women whom he charms and discards. He lives defiantly outside of the system, refusing to conform to the demands of anyone (including himself).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e232a4d4a9c69842559219c4966e0799fb9ce144","amp;dn":"Naked+1993+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e232a4d4a9c69842559219c4966e0799fb9ce144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,50,164,212,169,198,152,66,85,146,25,196,150,110,7,153,251,156,225,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
