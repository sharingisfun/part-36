Born on March 9, 1945, in Catford, England, Trower spent the early '60s playing guitar in various London-based outfits, the most successful one being the R&amp;B group the Paramounts, who specialized mostly in covers, but managed to issue several singles between 1963 and 1965. It wasn't until 1967 that Trower received his big break, however, when he joined Procol Harum. The group had just scored a worldwide smash hit with &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale,&quot; but the only problem was that the band's leader, singer/pianist Gary Brooker, didn't have a proper band to back him. Brooker was previously a bandmate of Trower's in the Paramounts, and offered the guitar slot in his new fast-rising project to his old friend. As a result, Trower appeared on such Procol Harum classics as 1967's Procol Harum, 1968's Shine on Brightly, 1969's A Salty Dog, 1970's Home (which spawned the popular Trower tune &quot;Whiskey Train&quot;), and 1971's Broken Barricades. \r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:                             Mp3\r\nAudio Quality:\t\t            Very High (Lossy)\r\nEncoder Settings:\t            Constant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\r\nContains:\t\t            Album Art, ID Tags\r\nGenre:                              Rock\r\nRelease Notes:                      Conerted From FLAC Files With dBpoweramp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.Day Of The Eagle\r\n02.Caledonia\r\n03.Confessin' Midnight\r\n04.Too Rolling Stoned (Live)\r\n05.Bridge Of Sighs\r\n06.Man Of The World\r\n07.Take A Fast Train\r\n08.Daydream\r\n09.Gonna Be More Suspicious\r\n10.About To Begin\r\n11.Long Misty Days\r\n12.Alethea (Live)\r\n13.In City Dreams\r\n14.Victims Of The Fury\r\n15.Rock Me Baby (Live)\r\n16.The Ring\r\n17.Caravan To Midnight\r\n\r\n                ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
