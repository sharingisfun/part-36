HP told me the glass could not be removed from the PSC 2610 but after a little searching I found this on their website. I was actually lead to the page from one of the forums on fixyourownprinter.com. \n\nThis pdf is a slightly modified HP website page to include the 2610. \n\nHere's a good all-around no streaking glass cleaner. Beats Windex any day of the week. To a quart spray bottle add 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of household ammonia (not &quot;sudsy&quot;) and fill with water. Windex and most commercial glass cleaners will streak and you definitely don't want that on your scanner glass.\n\nHP recommends that you use only distilled water.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f7922eb54004d269ba703ef14a167358cdb49c","amp;dn":"Scanner+Glass+Cleaning%2C+HP+PSC+Printer-Scanners","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f7922eb54004d269ba703ef14a167358cdb49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,247,146,46,181,64,4,210,105,186,112,62,241,74,22,115,88,205,180,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
