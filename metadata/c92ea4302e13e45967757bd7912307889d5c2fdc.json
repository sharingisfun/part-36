The game      \n             action takes place in space and on the surface of various    \n             planets. The genre of the game is freeplay RPG with FPS and  \n             space sim combat elements.                                   \n                                                                          \n             &quot;Precursors&quot; and &quot;White Gold: War In Paradise&quot; are developed  \n             using the Vital Engine 3. It has shader 3.0 support and      \n             features various post rendering effects like HDR, motion     \n             blur and others. In comparison with the Vital Engine 2 the   \n             physics system has been improved and moreover, two of the    \n             main features of the engine are destructible objects, which  \n             will be found everywhere in the games, and support of one    \n             huge unified playing area.                                   \n                                                                          \n             You will fight your enemies in space as well as on the       \n             surface of various planets. You will be able to work for     \n             different factions and carry out their quests to earn money,  \n             which is quite essential for your hero. The money will give  \n             you the opportunity to buy new weapons, make technical       \n             upgrades or repair your damaged spaceship.                   \n                                                                          \n             You can explore a planet's surface using a wide choice of    \n             different vehicles, but in space you will use only one       \n             ship which will be given to you at the beginning of the      \n             game. RPG stats will allows you to upgrade not only the      \n             personal characteristics of your hero but the technical      \n             abilities of your spaceship as well.                         \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n             Features:                                                    \n                                                                          \n              - Unique gameplay: combines such genres as RPG/FPS/space    \n              - A real opportunity to visit different planets             \n              - More than 250 exciting quests and tasks                   \n              - Partly organic weapons with ammunition, in need of food   \n              - Controllable space ships and other modes of transport     \n              - Huge variety of enemies                                   \n              - Ability to trade                                          \n              - Interaction with hundreds of NPC of different enemy       \n                races                                                     \n              - Weather conditions, day and night, atmospheric phenomena  \n              - Update 1.1 integrated into game installer                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                   iNSTALL NOTES                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                            \n                    - Unpack                                               \n                    - Install the game                                    \n                    - Update the game to version 1.1(optional)            \n                    - For 1.1 use our keygen to activate the game:        \n                      * Click 'Get Num' to generate a serial number,      \n                        copy/paste it to activation dialog.               \n                      * Choose 'I already have an Activation Key' and     \n                        copy/paste your Hardware code back to keygen.     \n                      * Press 'Get Key' to generate Activation Key,       \n                        copy/paste it to activation dialog, press Next.   \n                    - Feel the power of TRiViUM :&gt;                        \n                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                    GROUP NOTES                               \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                              GFI guys, no more please                      \n                                                                            \n                                                               \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nall the useful information in the file trivium.nfo and\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://peerat.ru:8080/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3847&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://peerat.ru:8080/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3847&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c92ea4302e13e45967757bd7912307889d5c2fdc","amp;dn":"The+Precursors+%5BENG%5D%5BGame+Factory+Interative%5D+2010+TRiViUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c92ea4302e13e45967757bd7912307889d5c2fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,46,164,48,46,19,228,89,103,117,123,215,145,35,7,136,157,92,47,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
