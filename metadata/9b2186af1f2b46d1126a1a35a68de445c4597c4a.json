Transparency fixes for plate armor and several monsters such as evil eyes and drakes. Amazing that they haven't fixed this on live yet. \n\n2. Annoying and overly loud sounds were removed such as thunder, howling tunnel wind, and bags/chests opening/closing. I still can't find that fucking lavastorm explosion sound in order to remove it. If you can find the name/location of that sound, contact me god damnit. &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7033110315093521303c1906155e131f1d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; If for some reason you are an autistic masochist that wants to listen to his pet laugh every time it auto attacks, you can restore these awful sounds by replacing &quot;soundassets&quot; in your EQ folder with the other one I've provided.\n\n3. Higher resolution textures for nearly everything. Humans, Dark elves, armored frogloks, and ALL robe textures have been upgraded significantly. The rest of the models have been lightly touched up by members of our community.\n\n4. Fancy transparent water for many classic zones such as Ocean of Tears and Timorous Deep. Necessary for the pvp server.\n\n5. Forumquest Texture Pack (not installed, but available in the folder)\n\n6. Three optional custom interfaces : DuxaUI, VertUI, and Casey2.9\nIt is important to have multiple hotbars, you should check these out.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstallation instructions:\n\n1. Unzip to your C drive\n\n2. Inside the folder find EQGAME.EXE \n\n3. Make a desktop shortcut for EQGAME (right click send to desktop shortcut)\n\n4. Right click your new desktop shortcut, go into properties\n\n5. Edit the target line to look like this:\n&quot;C:/EverQuest Project 1999/eqgame.exe&quot; patchme &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CJQIt7i.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CJQIt7i.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBasically you just added patchme to the end.\n\nNow if for some reason you aren't allowed to make a shortcut like this, just find &quot;Launch Titanium.bat&quot; in your EQ folder and use that to load the game.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop me a line on my website : CaseysFuckingCorner dot webs dot com\n\nAlso you can find me in game on the red server under these character names : Kakashi, Shawn, and Casey\n\nHave fun, be patient, and play on the PVP server. It will put hair on your chest you little bitch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2186af1f2b46d1126a1a35a68de445c4597c4a","amp;dn":"EverQuest+Titanium+-+Project+1999+-+The+Scars+of+Velious","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b2186af1f2b46d1126a1a35a68de445c4597c4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,33,134,175,31,43,70,209,18,106,26,53,166,141,228,69,196,89,124,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
