He finds it very difficult to step out of the state of depression due to his recent loss and so intimidates his soldiers into bettering themselves to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. During his stay there, he came across a PKK militant called the 'Doctor' who intervenes in his phone calls with his wife through radio frequencies. This becomes almost habitual with frequent exchange of hostile words. ' Why do you live like pigs instead of being a doctor in your village and serving your people' the Major asks and 'I would rather live in my mountains as a freeman than being a doctor from your universities' the Doctor replies. In parallel to that, we observe daily routines of Turkish soldiers and their sincere phone calls with their loved ones as we approach to the inevitable end. \n-------a bit spoiler--------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c9196b2a4b049780519ed43e6577060e887d35","amp;dn":"Nefes+Vatan+Sagolsun+%5B2009%5D+XviD+DvDrip-DMR+%5BENG%2C+FRE%2C+GER+Subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c9196b2a4b049780519ed43e6577060e887d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,201,25,107,42,75,4,151,128,81,158,212,62,101,119,6,14,136,125,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
