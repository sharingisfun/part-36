On Fireball Roberts,\nhe fashions the kind of simple, bluesy, yearning ballad he has long been the\nmaster of, aching guitar work wrapped around finely turned lyrics: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was trying\nto leave the black dog home/But it followed me to your house/And it carried its\nown chewed bone.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But this slow, melancholy style is outweighed by upbeat\nbar-band rock and an optimistic desire to get back out there. Even the glimpses\nof world-weariness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI used to roll through here like a freight train, but my\nwheelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s come offÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are trumped by the overall air of defiance. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m gonna go\ndown swinginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hiatt sings, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsinging till the end.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Excellent news.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d273e9d66d330b1258cb438c3a33756b2e10699b","amp;dn":"John_Hiatt-The_Open_Road-2010-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d273e9d66d330b1258cb438c3a33756b2e10699b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,115,233,214,109,51,11,18,88,203,67,140,58,51,117,107,46,16,105,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
