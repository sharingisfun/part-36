This self-contained text offers a host of new mathematical tools and strategies which develop a connection between analysis and other mathematical disciplines, such as physics and engineering. A broad view of mathematics is presented throughout; the text is excellent for the classroom or self-study. It is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, as well as for researchers engaged in the interplay between applied analysis, mathematical physics, and numerical analysis.\n\nKey features:\n\n*Uses competition-inspired problems as a platform for training typical inventive skills;\n\n*Develops basic valuable techniques for solving problems in mathematical analysis on the real axis and provides solid preparation for deeper study of real analysis;\n\n*Includes numerous examples and interesting, valuable historical accounts of ideas and methods in analysis;\n\n*Offers a systematic path to organizing a natural transition that bridges elementary problem-solving activity to independent exploration of new results and properties.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c6d2e2da1bc78adc42b6460967497bbb5d4e10","amp;dn":"Problems+in+Real+Analysis%3A+Advanced+Calculus+on+the+Real+Axis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c6d2e2da1bc78adc42b6460967497bbb5d4e10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,198,210,226,218,27,199,138,220,66,182,70,9,103,73,123,187,93,78,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
