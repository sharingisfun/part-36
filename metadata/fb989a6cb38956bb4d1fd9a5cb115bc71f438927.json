Both have identical\npressing faults at the end of 'Shelter From The Storm' and intermittantly through 'Buckets Of Rain', both\nalso have some vinyl clicks. I exchanged both for replacement copies and these were the same so I assume\nmany circulating copies must also suffer from this. The copy transfered here has only been played once\npreviously.\n\nTransfer Information: Half Speed Mastered Vinyl LP &gt; Technics SL-110/SME 3009 Series 111/Goldring G1010 &gt;\nOnkyo P-304 Pre Amp &gt; Soundforge 9 (Tracks Splits, DC Offset) &gt; FLAC Level 6 Align on sector boundaries\n\nJTT, September 2009\n\nSide One\n1.
