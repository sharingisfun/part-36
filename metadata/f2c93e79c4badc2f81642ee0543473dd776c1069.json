Now, in remission, Rayna starts fresh at a new school, lands a new job, and desperately tries for normalcy. She ignores signs that she may be slipping into the world she has tried so hard to climb out of. But these days, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than just hallucinations that keep Rayna up at night. Students are dying, and she may be the only one who can stop it. Can she keep her job, her sanity, and her friends from dying at the hands of angels she can't admit to seeing?\nGenre: Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c93e79c4badc2f81642ee0543473dd776c1069","amp;dn":"A+Shimmer+of+Angels+-+Lisa+M.+Basso.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c93e79c4badc2f81642ee0543473dd776c1069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,201,62,121,196,186,220,47,129,100,46,224,84,52,115,221,119,108,16,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
