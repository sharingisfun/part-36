Tightly written, highly accessible sophomore outing by writer-director Chen Daming is given real flavor by its largely nonpro cast, and has none of the alienating artiness and anomie often seen in Mainland fest fare. On a level playing-field, this deserves Western distribution, with TV sales a bonus in Europe.\n\nPic has the same generosity toward its characters as the early films of Ang Lee (&quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;) and Taiwan pics of Sylvia Chang (&quot;Tonight Nobody Goes Home,&quot;). At the very least, on a technical and writing level, it shows Chen's first movie, caper-drama-romancer &quot;Manhole&quot; (2002), wasn't a one-off.\n\nPic was largely shot in (and is a gentle love letter to) Kaifeng, the helmer's own birthplace in Henan province, central China. It's based on real stories played out by the real people (with roles switched), though reworked into a commercial feature with no hint of documentary. Helmer -- who cameos as a film director in the opening sequence -- also trained in an opera school, and his familiarity with theatrical types and the greasepaint life infuses the script in an informal way.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard01-5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard01-5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard02-5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard02-5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard03-5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard03-5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------my rip--------\n\n~~~~~~ Ji quan bu ning.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,460,140,032                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:46:07                \n\nFrame Count:....................................152638             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................688                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................384                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.792                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1633                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.258&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
