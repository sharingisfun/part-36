So this one doesn&amp;#039;t. Great.\n\n\nYear:       2004\nGenre:      I would say a mixture of rock and metal, but not heavy metal. Nice :)\nTotal time: 55 minutes\nBitrate:    As usual (meaning like my coming torrents) 128 kbps. I&amp;#039;m SORRY, but that&amp;#039;s what my music is like. And no, I can not tell the difference. Okay then.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n\n1.  Find the Real - 4:43\n2.  One Day Remains - 4:05\n3.  Open Your Eyes - 4:58\n4.  Burn It Down - 6:11\n5.  Metalingus - 4:19\n6.  Broken Wings - 5:06\n7.  In Loving Memory - 5:40\n8.  Down to My Last - 4:46\n9.  Watch Your Words - 5:25\n10. Shed My Skin - 5:08\n11. The End Is Here - 4:57\n\n\n\n\nEspecially, I like Find the Real, Broken Wings, In Loving Memory, and Down to My Last.\nI hope you will like it too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d9abc162ebae99819467eb69348faf2719a0e7","amp;dn":"Alter+Bridge+-+One+Day+Remains++%7Bby+marvin_snemand%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d9abc162ebae99819467eb69348faf2719a0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,217,171,193,98,235,174,153,129,148,103,235,105,52,143,175,39,25,160,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
