DarkWave features ease of use for\nbeginners and high quality for studio professionals\ncreating complicated projects. It allows users to\nconnect various machines included with DarkWave Studio\nin addition to machines that adhere to Steinberg's VST\neffect and VSTi instrument format in a virtual studio\nenvironment limited only by your imagination.\n\nFor high performance the program has a top of the\nrange scheduling algorithm that allows instruments and\neffects to run in parralel on today's multi core\ncomputers, allowing more CPU intensive projects to\nwork in real time. For top performance on the latest\n64-bit machines a 64-bit version is included in\naddition to a 32-bit version of the program for\nbackwards compatibility with 32-bit operating systems\nand VST plugins.\n\nA pattern editor with a piano roll interface is\nincluded to allow the creation of patterns of music\nfor each instrument with ease. A sequencer allows\npatterns to be arranged into a song, allowing reuse of\npatterns to rapidly create a song with repeated\nelements.\n\nDarkWave Studio can also be used live with the MIDI\nInput machine which allows for playing of virtual\ninstruments with a MIDI or USB music keyboard.\n\nMultitrack recording is simple with DarkWave Studio's\nmultitrack hard disk recorder which allows any number\nof recording machines to be placed in the studio and\nthen controlled from the hard disk recorder\ninterface. Recording can be synchronised with the\nstart and end of a song by starting recording of all\ntracks simultaneously as playing the song by the click\nof a button in the sequencer.\n\nDarkWave Studio comes with the following built in\nmachines:\n\nES SpatialVerb: Room modelling reverb unit with\nadvanced circulant feedback delay network to minimize\nringing caused by most reverbs.\n\nES DGenR8: Virtual analog drum module made to sound\nand function just like the classic Roland TR-909.\n\nES AntiAlias: Up to 32 times oversampling digital\nfilter to enhance the quality of the recording.\n\nES BassHead: Virtual analog subtractive synthesizer\nwith 2 bandlimited oscillators, 3 low frequency\noscillators, 2 multimode filters, seperate amplifier\nand filter envelope generators and many controls to\nadjust the sound.\n\nES Mixer: The latest addition to DarkWave Studio, ES\nMixer is an 8 track plus 2 auxillary track production\nmixer. Each track has a 3 band equalizer, 60dB range\nvolume control, panning control, 2 auxillary sends for\nthe normal tracks, mute and solo buttons, and a stereo\nlevel meter with 60dB range.\n\nDarkWave Studio also includes: ES Stomp (Rave Kick\nGenerator) and ES QuadDelay (4 Parralel Delay Units\nwith LFO modulated delay time and a band pass filter).\n\nRequirements\nWindows Vista, XP, 2000\n64-bit Windows Recommended For Best Performance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd2ba9c3394e08222590dcc92abf06a0552ed75a","amp;dn":"DarkWave+Studio+2.6.8+x86+x64+2009.01.17+%5BEXTC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd2ba9c3394e08222590dcc92abf06a0552ed75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,43,169,195,57,78,8,34,37,144,220,201,42,191,6,160,85,46,215,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
