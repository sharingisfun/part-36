It was his last album on Virgin.\n\nThis is the only album where Mike Oldfield does the main vocals himself, and was pleased to find to discover that he was not as bad a singer as he thought he was. It has been claimed that this was because of monetary reasons. Oldfield took singing lessons before recording the album. Probably because of his bad feelings towards Virgin, his name is spelled out in full - Michael Oldfield - on this album. The producer of the album, Tom Newman's name was also spelt out in a similar manner, as Thom Newman.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
