At the same time, his own household mirrored the fissures that split the nation: the \ngreat emancipator was married to the daughter of a slave owner from Kentucky. Mary Todd Lincoln was an aristocratic southerner who met Lincoln when he was still a backwoods politician lacking in experience and sophistication. Although \nshe remained fiercely loyal to her husband and the Union cause, two of her brothers fought for the South. Their marriage was long and turbulent, and knew many trials, including the loss of two children. Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House \nDivided weaves together the lives of the two Lincolns, drawing us into their long-vanished world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3cc4ea0b018b125c275b0599d0f6949cc591c07","amp;dn":"Abraham+and+Mary+Lincoln+-+A+House+Divided+.x264+-+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3cc4ea0b018b125c275b0599d0f6949cc591c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,204,78,160,176,24,177,37,194,117,176,89,157,15,105,73,204,89,28,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
