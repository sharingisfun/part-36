This third edition focuses on new developments in the field, such as mapping of complex arrhythmias, stereotaxis, and image integration. This useful resource for basic and clinical electrophysiologists illuminates the path to better and safer mapping. A unique feature of this edition is the inclusion of a DVD, which illustrates real-time data from actual cases.
