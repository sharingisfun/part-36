Merritt said he &quot;thought of the two records as a pair&quot; \nand considered titling the albums True and False; ultimately, \nhe couldn't decide which title would correspond with which album. \nThe song &quot;The Dada Polka&quot; is the only track to utilize an electric guitar. \nMerritt also avoided using a traditional drum kit, \nfurther separating the sound of Realism from the noise pop of Distortion. \nAlong with Distortion and the 2004 album i, Realism was also recorded without the use of synthesizers, \ncompleting the band's &quot;no-synth trilogy&quot;.\n\nJoshua Rifkin, who arranged the Judy Collins albums In My Life and Wildflowers, \nwas cited by Merritt as a creative influence for Realism.\n\n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee\n\nSONG LIST..\n\n01.
