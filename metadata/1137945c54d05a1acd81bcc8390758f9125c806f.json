Encoded 320kbps [Lame] mp3. Front cover only included.\n\n\nEvermore are an alternative rock band originally from Feilding, New Zealand,\nnow based in Melbourne, Australia. Evermore have sold in excess of 250,000\nalbums, have been nominated for 6 ARIA Awards, have had a #1 single with 'Light\nSurrounding You' which was the third most played Australian song in 2007, and\nare undeniably one of Australia's biggest rock bands.\n\n\n'Truth Of The World: Welcome To The Show' is Evermore's third studio album.\nEvermore's singer and guitarist Jon Hume said about the album &quot;I heard someone\nsay that albums were dead and everyone just wants three minute songs these\ndays. That's exactly what we are trying to fight with this record. We hit reset\non what this band was about, threw everything out and just imagined the record\nwe would want to hear someone else make. Something you could put on and not\never want to hit skip, one piece of music that ebbs and flows but never stops.\nIt's a concept album that takes inspiration from trash entertainment, news\nheadlines and political propaganda, and turns it into an over the top, fun,\nrock'n'roll show.&quot;\n\n\nTracks:\n01 Plugged In\n02 Tonight On The Show (Truth Of The World Pt.1)\n03 Between The Lines\n04 &quot;Max Is Stable&quot;\n05 Hey Boys And Girls (Truth Of The World Pt.2)\n06 The Lonely Ones\n07 Girl With The World On Her Shoulders\n08 Front Page Story / Diamonds In The River\n09 Infotainmentology (Truth Of The World Pt.3)\n10 Join The Party\n11 Everybody's Doing It\n12 Chemical Miracle / Faster\n13 Can You Hear Me?\n\n\nEnjoy The Music And Please Seed As Much As You Can. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1137945c54d05a1acd81bcc8390758f9125c806f","amp;dn":"Evermore+-+Truth+Of+The+World+%5B2009%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+%5B1337x%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1137945c54d05a1acd81bcc8390758f9125c806f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,55,148,92,84,208,90,26,205,129,188,200,57,7,88,249,18,92,128,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
