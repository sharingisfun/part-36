All along we've shared our passion as the worlds, the people and the godly powers have been developed and honed. We've received imaginative ideas, passion and support back many times over. GODUS isn't just a new game, it's a new way of making games. We're loving the process and hope you will join us!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn4.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/extras/Godus_Main_616.png?t=1380902283&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn4.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/extras/Godus_Main_616.png?t=1380902283&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/ss_c81bc41b5b709d4217fe2f5856a43f9e04a328fa.600x338.jpg?t=1380902283&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/ss_c81bc41b5b709d4217fe2f5856a43f9e04a328fa.600x338.jpg?t=1380902283&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/ss_f46f417004fb01bcd7bee13f0e9ed810b8c315d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1380902283&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/ss_f46f417004fb01bcd7bee13f0e9ed810b8c315d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1380902283&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/ss_63279ed6852d0092cb4796765225ad8adb04e261.600x338.jpg?t=1380902283&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/232810/ss_63279ed6852d0092cb4796765225ad8adb04e261.600x338.jpg?t=1380902283&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGODUS empowers you in the role of a god, allowing you to sculpt every inch of a beautiful world that you look down upon, on which a population of Followers settle and multiply. As you mould every aspect of your unique utopia, a civilisation will blossom across your land and offer you their belief. The more Followers that believe in you, the more powerful you will become.\n\nWhilst you are free to lose yourself in this tranquil experience, other gods reign outside of the ever-expanding reach of your influence. If you so wish, you may challenge other gods and their civilisations to epic multiplayer battles that involve hundreds of Followers fighting in your name whilst you cast devastating god powers from the skies above. As you conquer more lands, your powers will grow allowing you to nurture the advancement of your own Followers.
