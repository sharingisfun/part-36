His contribution to music, dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.\nIn the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. \nHe has sold over 750 million records worldwide (Thriller is the best-selling album of all time with more than 110 million) \nHomepage:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.michaeljackson.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.michaeljackson.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson_albums_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson_albums_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nHaving sex is like playing bridge.
