I occasionally refer to it that way, but mostly, I call it the Xoom.\nAbout This Book\nLike all For Dummies books, this book is a reference. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother trying to read it from cover to cover. Instead, flip to the chapter or\nsection that contains the information you need at the time, follow the steps to accomplish your task, and then put the book aside and get\nback to work. These tasks, for example, are explained clearly, each in its own section:\nTurning your Motorola Xoom on and off\nSetting up your Internet connection\nTyping without a keyboard\nSending and receiving e-mail\nBrowsing the web\nDownloading and running apps\nTaking and sharing photos and videos\nBacking up and password-protecting your Motorola Xoom\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother memorizing anything. Just flip to the page you need, read the explanation or follow the steps, and get on with your life.\nUnlike user manuals, this book lets you skip the dry, boring stuff and simply get things done.\nWhen the book tells you to do something specific, you see numbered steps. A specific step may look like this:\n2. Touch the Microphone icon.\nThis step tells you to touch the little picture of the microphone on the screen.\nFinally, you find a full table of contents in the front of the book for general reference and an index in the back for more detailed\nsearches.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1476b89f00b0bdfdc125bd4406fe4de670877779","amp;dn":"motorola+XOOM+For+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1476b89f00b0bdfdc125bd4406fe4de670877779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,118,184,159,0,176,189,253,193,37,189,68,6,254,77,230,112,135,119,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
