His birth. 2. His diagnosis. 3. This play. It was so profound in the sense that it had such depth to it. It really comes from the heart. It puts a real face on autism. In every sense. A son\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s face. A mother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s face. A father\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s face.   Profound also because it penetrates beyond the superficial. Beyond the diagnosis. To the real struggles and triumphs families like ours face.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\n- Sarah Richard (Mother of a Boy with Autism in Ohio, Attended both Nights of the Premier!)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;These pancakes are topped with frustration and triumph, so you have the ingredients for a memorable experience!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\n- Sean Barron (Co-Author of Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships:  Decoding Social Mysteries Through The Unique Perspectives of Autism (with Temple Grandin)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;I want to take this opportunity to tell you how much my wife, Carol, and I enjoyed your presentation of Pancakes and a Lobster Tank. We found it both entertaining and informative. It was entertaining because of your story-telling format which is a tried-and-true method of engrossing an audience. It works from its inception in childhood to very old age. In the hands of a skillful writer and presenter such as yourself, it can leave the audience thinking about all kinds of unimagined things years after the curtain falls.\n\nThe piece was informative for those untutored in the arcana of the autism spectrum. Moreover, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtalk-backÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ segment showed that it truly resonated with parents of autistic children in the audience. But the power of the presentation lay in giving all parents pause to consider their attitudes toward their role and their children. Parenting poses colossal challenges in normal situations. It was your good humor and humanity in dealing with an autistic child that offered an object lesson in expectations and buck-stopping.\nPlease finish you memoir. You are on to something with this very personal story. But keep presenting Pancakes, as well. People need to learn about true character in an age of flight from lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s responsibilities.  Brava, Rebecca!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n- Dr. Salvatore Caronite (Emeritus Professor of Psychology)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;...You have a poignant and timely story to tell.  The mixture of comedy and pathos left the audiences spellbound...The theatrical doubleplay of laughter through tears was the perfect balance...they REALLY understand your story and need it to be told.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\n- Dr. Daniel Nadon (Director of the Premier Performances of this work.  Thank you so much for making this come to life!)\n\nIn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPancakes and a Lobster Tank:  Living with Autism, Loving AlexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Rebecca Maher provides her audience with a humorous and heart-wrenching account of a motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experiences raising a child with autism.  It is a work that is sometimes tragic, always emotionally stirring, and ultimately a triumph of the human spirit and condition.  This work provokes a spectrum of emotions that must be experienced.  Rebecca sums it up best when she says that life with a child with autism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦can be a lot like a roller coaster ride complete with screaming, panic induced laughter, and someone may ultimately vomit.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTo buy the whole CD, or get more information, please visit www.rebeccamaher.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729e25d8176a5244f07edc3054124676e2c149c5","amp;dn":"Rebecca+Maher%5C%27s+Pancakes+and+a+Lobster+Tank%3B+Living+with+Autism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729e25d8176a5244f07edc3054124676e2c149c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,158,37,216,23,106,82,68,240,126,220,48,84,18,70,118,226,193,73,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
