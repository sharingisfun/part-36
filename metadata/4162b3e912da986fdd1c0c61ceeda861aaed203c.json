I received this disc from an ex-girlfriend years ago and any time I'm kicking back some brews I love to pop this in and dance a jig! Many of these songs are renditions of old classics and they are done very well. The vocals and instrumentals are really captivating and you just kinda lose yourself in the track. There are plenty of ironic and funny sayings throughout and it's a great play thru and thru.\n\n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\n\n01 - Whiskey In The Jar \n02 - Cod Liver Oil / Coolies \n03 - Muirsheen Durkin \n04 - Seven Drunken Nights \n05 - Three Youg Ladies Drinking Whiskey Before Breakfast\n06 - The Cobbler \n07 - The Wild Rover \n08 - Bold O'Donaghue \n09 - Finnegan's Wake \n10 - I'll Tell Me Ma \n11 - Poor Paddy Works On The Railways\n12 - Rocky Road to Dublin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4162b3e912da986fdd1c0c61ceeda861aaed203c","amp;dn":"The+Shannon+Clovers+-+Irish+Drinking+Songs+%282003%29+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4162b3e912da986fdd1c0c61ceeda861aaed203c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,98,179,233,18,218,152,111,221,28,12,97,206,237,168,97,170,237,32,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
