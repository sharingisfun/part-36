The plot is patterned after the film Twelve O\\&amp;#039;Clock High, which producer-screenwriter Sy Bartlett also wrote, with elements also mirroring Above and Beyond, a film written by his collaborator, Beirne Lay, Jr..\nRock Hudson plays a United States Air Force Colonel, Jim Caldwell, who has just been re-assigned as a B-52 wing commander. He must shape up his men to pass a grueling readiness inspection that the previous commander had failed, and for which he had been relieved of his command. Caldwell is also recently married, and as a tough commanding officer doing whatever he has to do to shape up his command, his wife sees a side to him that she hadn\\&amp;#039;t seen before.\nThe film also stars Rod Taylor, Mary Peach, Barry Sullivan, Kevin McCarthy, Henry Silva, Robert Lansing, Leif Erickson, and Richard Anderson.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:034ac99405228a0bc5a5f68b9924a72406583828","amp;dn":"Gathering_of_Eagles%5B1963%5DVHSrip%5BENG%5D-Aero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"034ac99405228a0bc5a5f68b9924a72406583828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,74,201,148,5,34,138,11,197,165,246,139,153,36,167,36,6,88,56,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
