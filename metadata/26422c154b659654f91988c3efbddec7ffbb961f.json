Enjoy.\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nAmazon.com\n\nAaron Sorkin, bless him, believes that &quot;the people who watch television shows aren't dumber than the people who make television shows.&quot; He also believes that &quot;quality is not anathema to profit.&quot; He puts these idealistic words into the mouth of Jordan McDeere (Amanda Peet), the new, impolitic NBS TV president whose first order of business is to revitalize the network's cash cow, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, a long-running live late-night sketch-comedy series reeling from the Howard Beale-esque on-air meltdown of its creator (Judd Hirsch, alas, limited to the pilot episode). With this Upstairs/Backstage look at Studio 60's tumultuous network politics and stormy personal relationships, Sorkin, the creator of Sports Night and The West Wing, once again tried to raise the bar of prime time fare. That he didn't quite clear it makes this one-season wonder a fascinating object lesson of great hopes and dashed expectations. Studio 60 was perhaps the most hotly debated series of the 2006 season and, love it or hate it, all its strengths and flaws can be savored and savaged anew with this complete-series set.\n\nPretty much above reproach is the ensemble. Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford head the cast as comedy writer Matt and executive producer Danny, former Studio 60 hands whom Jordan brings back to &quot;save&quot; the show. Steven Weber costars as network chairman Jack Rudolph, who clashes with Jordan over reality programming (he wants it, she doesn't), is embroiled in network negotiations with China, and must fend off angry affiliates offended by such sketches as &quot;Crazy Christians.&quot; Jordan contends with becoming tabloid fodder after her ex-husband leaks scandalous details of their past. Meanwhile, Matt, a sardonic atheist, is in a whole Ross and Rachel thing with Harriet (Emmy nominee Sarah Paulson), who is devoutly religious and the show's galvanizing star performer (she does do a mean Holly Hunter). \n\nStudio 60 has much to say about comedy in wartime, the divided states of America, the creative process, and patriotism. Some of it is deftly handled, some of it is ham-handed and some of it patronizing. Most of it is delivered in Sorkin's signature chock-a-block style and with walk-and-talk urgency. But even at its most maddening, there are enough riveting moments (a performance by displaced New Orleans musicians in &quot;The Christmas Show&quot;), jaw-dropping developments (&quot;I'm coming for you, Jordan,&quot; warns Danny, suddenly-turned romantic stalker), and indelible performances (John Goodman's Emmy-winning turn as a plain-speaking Pahrump, NV judge not impressed with the Hollywood types before him in the two-part &quot;Nevada Day&quot;) to make Studio 60 a series worth revisiting, if only as a guilty pleasure. The pilot episode commentary by Sorkin and director Thomas Schlamme, as well as a behind-the-scenes featurette, were produced before the show was canceled, robbing this series' fervent fans of the opportunity for some closure. --Donald Liebenson\n\n\nCast\n\nStudio 60 employed a broad ensemble cast that portrayed the rotating personnel involved in the production of a late-night comedy show.\n\nDanny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) is a former segment producer for Studio 60 who is asked to return as director/executive producer when executive producer Wes Mendell is fired. He works closely with Matt Albie, his longtime friend. He is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic.\n\nMatt Albie (Matthew Perry) is a former writer for Studio 60 who takes over production along with long-time friend Danny Tripp, as executive producer and head writer. He is also Harriet's on-off boyfriend.\n\nJordan McDeere (Amanda Peet) is the recently hired president of entertainment programming of network National Broadcasting System, of which Studio 60 is the flagship show.\n\nHarriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) is a &quot;multi-talented&quot; performer, a devout Christian, and one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; main stars of Studio 60. She is also Matt Albie's on-off girlfriend. She also dated Luke Scott, a former writer at Studio 60 and Matt's rival, now a big-time director. The character of Harriet is partially based on Kristin Chenoweth, whom Sorkin previously dated before she worked on The West Wing.\n\nTom Jeter (Nate Corddry) is another of the show's &quot;Big Three.&quot; He is from the Midwest, and his brother is serving as an airman in the USAF deployed in Afghanistan. During the course of the show, he begins dating Lucy Kenwright, one of the staff writers.\n\nSimon Stiles (D. L. Hughley) is the final member of the &quot;Big Three.&quot; An alumnus of the Yale School of Drama, his original intention was to become a dramatic actor, rather than a comedian.\n\nJack Rudolph (Steven Weber) is the chairman of the National Broadcasting System, and Jordan's boss. During the course of the show, he and his wife separate.\n\nCal Shanley (Timothy Busfield) is the director of the Studio 60. He has two children and is a military history buff. (Busfield has also directed several episodes of the series, as he did for Sports Night.)\n\nJeannie Whatley (Ayda Field) is a member of the show's ensemble. She is Matt's occasional lover and Harriet's close friend and is a bit of a gossip on the set.\n\nAlex Dwyer (Simon Helberg) is a member of the show's ensemble; he is recognized as the complement to Harriet Hayes, being the premier male impressionist in the cast. He has at least one recurring sketch, The Nicolas Cage Show, in which he plays the title character, and has also portrayed Tom Cruise and Ben Stiller.\n\nDylan Killington (Nate Torrence) is a rookie member of the show's ensemble. Dylan plays a number of different characters in the show-within-a-show. During &quot;Nevada Day Part - II&quot;, Simon goes to Nevada with Tom, Danny, and Jack; Matt then asks a reluctant Dylan to fill in for Simon in News 60. He has a crush on Jeannie.\n\nSamantha Li (Camille Chen) is a member of the show's ensemble.\n\nRicky Tahoe (Evan Handler) is a former co-executive producer of the show and former co-head of the writers' room. In &quot;The Option Period&quot;, he and Ron left Studio 60 to pursue a pilot show for Fox called &quot;Peripheral Vision Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a character from an old Studio 60 sketch; Ricky's departure was marked by a hostile shouting match with Matt.\n\nRon Oswald (Carlos Jacott) is a former co-executive producer of the show and former co-head of the writers' room. In &quot;The Option Period&quot;, he left the show with Ricky to pursue a pilot show for Fox called Peripheral Vision Man ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a character from an old Studio 60 sketch.\n\nWilson White (Edward Asner) is the head of TMG (Tunney Media Group), the conglomerate that owns the NBS network. He is a principal investor in the Macau deal.\n\nLucy Kenwright (Lucy Davis) is a junior writer on the show and the only pre-Matt and Danny writer to remain after Ricky and Ron's departure. Lucy and Darius were supposed to get their first sketch on the air in &quot;B-12&quot;. The sketch was about a bungling hostage taker, but was cancelled when a real-life hostage-taker killed his entire family and then himself just after the show started. During the course of the show, Lucy begins dating Tom Jeter.\n\nDarius Hawthorne (Columbus Short) is Matt's assistant writer. Matt and Simon hired Darius after seeing his poor stand-up act in &quot;The Wrap Party&quot;. During &quot;The Harriet Dinner&quot; he argues with Simon because Darius passed a sketch, pitched by Simon, to Lucy.\n\nAndy Mackinaw (Mark McKinney) was introduced in &quot;B-12&quot; after Ricky and Ron's departure when Matt needed an extra writer's help. Andy was a writer on Studio 60 prior to Matt and Danny's initial departure from the show. Since that time, Andy's wife and daughter died in a car accident. Andy is very serious and has only been seen smiling once.\n\nMartha O'Dell (Christine Lahti) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist working on a story for Vanity Fair about the new leadership of Studio 60. She ends up easily uncovering almost every detail of the cast and crew's personal lives. Martha's character is based on the columnist Maureen Dowd, who once dated Sorkin.\n\nSuzanne (Merritt Wever) is a former production assistant on the show who becomes Matt's assistant in the episode &quot;B-12&quot;. She confronts Matt about his drug use in the episode &quot;Breaking News&quot;.\n\nHallie Galloway (Stephanie Childers) is the vice-president of alternative programming (a.k.a. reality TV) for NBS and has developed an adversarial relationship with Jordan. She first appeared in the episode &quot;Monday&quot;. McDeere has expressed her fear that Galloway is being groomed to take her place after the rocky start to McDeere's tenure as president of the network.\n\nMary Tate (Kari Matchett) is a lawyer from law firm Gage Whitney Pace who is hired by NBS and has a sexual interest in Matt. Between &quot;Breaking News&quot; and &quot;What Kind of Day Has It Been&quot;, Mary is used as a second option to get Tom's brother out of the hostage situation.\n\nShelly Green (Wendy Phillips) is head of publicity for NBS.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26422c154b659654f91988c3efbddec7ffbb961f","amp;dn":"Studio+60+on+the+Sunset+Strip+%28Xvid+DVD+HiQuality+Rip%2C+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26422c154b659654f91988c3efbddec7ffbb961f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,66,44,21,75,101,150,84,249,25,136,195,239,189,222,199,255,187,150,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
