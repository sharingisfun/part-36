I always have. To me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very simple: if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how he does it: the art of the deal.\n\nBeginning with a week in TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-stakes life, Trump: The Art of the Deal gives us Trump in action. We see just how he operates day to dayÃ¢â‚¬â€how he runs his business and how he runs his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€as he chats with friends and family, clashes with enemies, efficiently buys up Atlantic CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top casinos, changes the face of the New York City skyline . . . and plans the tallest building in the world.\n\nTRUMP ON TRUMP: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I play it very loose. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. . . . I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEven a maverick plays by rules, and here Trump formulates his own eleven guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest deals; he shatters myths (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best dealÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½); he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-makerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art: from the abandoned property that became the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to the seedy hotel that became the Grand Hyatt; from the race to rebuild Central ParkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wollman Skating Rink to the byzantine saga of the property that became Trump Tower. And throughout, Trump talksÃ¢â‚¬â€really talksÃ¢â‚¬â€about how he does it.\n\nTRUMP ON TRUMP: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I always go into a deal anticipating the worst. If you plan for the worstÃ¢â‚¬â€if you can live with the worstÃ¢â‚¬â€the good will always take care of itself.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDonald Trump is blunt, brash, surprisingly old-fashioned in spotsÃ¢â‚¬â€and always, always an original. Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur and an unprecedented education in the art of the deal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most streetwise business book there isÃ¢â‚¬â€and a sizzling read for anyone interested in money and success.\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f10a278541640cb2ae5563a5302e6a0e7d25ed","amp;dn":"Donald+Trump+-+The+Art+of+the+Deal+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f10a278541640cb2ae5563a5302e6a0e7d25ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,241,10,39,133,65,100,12,178,174,85,99,165,48,46,106,14,125,37,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
