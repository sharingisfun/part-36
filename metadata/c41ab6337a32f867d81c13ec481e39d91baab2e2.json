These devastating wars had not only decimated the\n   population,  but  had  basicly  depleted the earth of its natural, precious\n   resources.  Some  of the  survivors saw no hope of salvation and decided to\n   leave the earth.  They  flew  into  the  skies  to face an uncertain future\n   elsewhere.\n\n   Determined to heal the planet,  the remaining survivors stayed behind in an\n   attempt  to  repair and revive the ravaged earth.  But  was  it  too  late?\n   Nothing that the  humans  attempted had successfully worked.  Humanity soon\n   realized that it was  practically  impossible  for  them to bring the earth\n   back to life on their own.\n\n   During this very bleak  and  urgent period, a special operation (code-named\n   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProject OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) was desperately undertaken, as the humans devoted a  massive\n   amount of time to  scientific  research  and  development in creating a new\n   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that had the functional capabilities of mending the planet.\n\n   In surprising time,  only  one  person  was  able  to successfully complete\n   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProject One,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  however  it  came at  a  great  price . . . the cost of his\n   life. The person he used for the  project was a girl named  Suguri.  Suguri\n   began her mission to  revive the earth.  She  singlehandedly tried to bring\n   the deteriorating planet back to life. Many years went by.\n\n   Eventually, the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s  natural  environment  steadily  improved.  Flowers\n   came into bloom. The forests continued to grow and spread and even wildlife\n   began to reappear.\n\n   The  earth  had  improved  to the point  where even humans were now able to\n   become  involved  again  with  Suguri in helping to effectively restore the\n   planet.\n\n   Time continued passing by when . . .\n\n   One day,  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsomethingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  unidentifiable was rapidly coming down from the sky.\n   It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t rain. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t snow.\n\n   It appeared that this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsomethingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was actually flying in the sky,  although\n   it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t  a  bird or an aircraft.  SUGURI  didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t  know  what  it was, but\n   everyone was worried, so she decided to investigate . . .\n\n     -   - -+- - - --:----------------------------------------------- -- -   -\n &lt;------------------ | -+- iNSTALL NOTES -\n     -   - -+- - - --:----------------------------------------------- -- -   -\n\n   1# Unzip and Unrar manually.\n   2# Run setup.exe to Install in your Hard Drive.\n   3# Hit AoSuguri.exe to play Acceleration of Suguri! or Hit AoSuguriXE.exe\n      to play Acceleration of Suguri X Edition!.\n   3# Have phun!\n\n   Ripped: Nothing\n\n -   - -- -----------------------------------------------:-- - - -+- -   -\n                                         - GREETiNGS -+- | --------------------&gt;\n -   - -- -----------------------------------------------:-- - - -+- -   -\n\n     BACKLASH # CRUDE # DiViNE # FAS # FAiRLiGHT # OUTLAWS # PWZ # RiTUEL\n                                TNT # ViTALiTY\n\n _:__________________________________ _ _____________ _     _ ______________:_\n  |                                                                         |\n  |                     IF YOU ENJOY THIS GAME, BUY IT!                     |\n _|_________ _  _    _                             _   _  _ ________________|_\n  :                            &quot;kiss my ass!&quot;                               :\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c41ab6337a32f867d81c13ec481e39d91baab2e2","amp;dn":"Acceleration+of+SUGURI+X-Edition+%28Highly+Compressed+Full%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c41ab6337a32f867d81c13ec481e39d91baab2e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,26,182,51,122,50,248,103,216,28,19,236,72,30,57,217,27,170,178,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
