Monsoon Diary is populated with characters like Raju, the milkman who named his cows after his wives; the iron-man who daily set up shop in NarayanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s front yard, picking up red-hot coals with his bare hands; her mercurial grandparents and inventive parents. Narayan illumines Indian customs while commenting on American culture from the vantage point of the sympathetic outsider. Her characters, like Narayan herself, have a thing or two to say about cooking and about life.\n\nIn this creative and intimate work, NarayanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s considerable vegetarian cooking talents are matched by stories as varied as Indian spicesÃ¢â‚¬â€at times pungent, mellow, piquant, and sweet. Tantalizing recipes for potato masala, dosa, and coconut chutney, among others, emerge from NarayanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absorbing tales about food and the solemn and quirky customs that surround it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c294ca7e7d227e7c0b6a7e7a6fc677ecc1d7736a","amp;dn":"Monsoon+Diary+by+Shoba+Narayan+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c294ca7e7d227e7c0b6a7e7a6fc677ecc1d7736a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,148,202,126,125,34,126,124,11,106,126,122,111,198,119,236,193,215,115,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
