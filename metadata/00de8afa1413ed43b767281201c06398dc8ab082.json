In this essay I explain in very simple words why private banks are not responsible for the crisis, and more specifically why private banks cannot create what is called &quot;inflationary money&quot;. I explain that inflationary money is always and everywhere created by governments. I also explain how and why governments do so. Finally I say a few things about conspiracy theories concerning the central banks, since the latter play a key role on what we call &quot;inflationary money&quot;. This essay is written for non economists with an interest on the subject . Even though I have postgraduate studies in economics I am not a specialist, and this document is the knowledge I gathered in an attempt to answer my own questions. Moreover, English is not my first language so you will have to excuse my syntax.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00de8afa1413ed43b767281201c06398dc8ab082","amp;dn":"The+Socialist+Myth+of+the+Greedy+Banker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00de8afa1413ed43b767281201c06398dc8ab082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,222,138,250,20,19,237,67,183,103,40,18,1,192,99,152,220,138,176,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
