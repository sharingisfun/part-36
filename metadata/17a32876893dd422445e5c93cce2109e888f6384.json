ÃƒÂ¢??\nShapeChanger is a tool to help you explore the powers of your mind. You decide on a possibility\nand hold it in mind while the image unfolds on your computer display. The outcome may be\nresponsive to your feelings and intentions. When it is, you will know it by the results you get.\nShapeChanger opens a door to measuring the effect of mind on matter. You can experience\nShapeChanger in the spirit of play, like a game, or as a vehicle to explore abilities you may not\nhave realized that you possess.\nPlaying ShapeChanger is a personal experience that helps you learn to focus your will and\nintentions on desired outcomes and make them happen.\nHereÃƒÂ¢??s What Happens ÃƒÂ¢??\nYou choose two images from a collection, and pick one to be your preferred target. ShapeChanger\nmixes them on the display, and then randomly shifts pixels from one to the other.\nThe two scenes compete for pixels, and which one wins is determined by a random process which\nyou influence to favor your target using your mind alone. According to the laws of chance, you\ncan expect to get the picture you want about half of the time. Your goal is to exceed that rate and\nmake your desired picture appear as rapidly as possible.\nPlay options include personal play where you compete against chance, and competitive or\nsupportive two-person modes. Groups can also work together to achieve their chosen\nShapeChanger goal or compete with each other.\nWe canÃƒÂ¢??t promise that you will become a master manipulator of your world, but we believe that\nplaying with ShapeChanger will give you practice in deciding what you want and focusing your\nintentions and mental images to get it. We canÃƒÂ¢??t promise an easy win in Lotto or a casino (the\nodds are too stacked against you), but we believe that holding positive intentions can give you an\nedge. Playing ShapeChanger will sharpen that edge, because it is designed to help you learn how\nto manifest your intentions.\nFor a major challenge to your conceptions of space-time, ShapeChanger allows you to play from\nremote locations and times. ShapeChanger can also be set to run as a continuous sequence\nresulting in scores that may be affected by whatÃƒÂ¢??s going on in its environment.\nThe purpose is for you to learn and have fun playing and beating chance, while practicing\nmanifesting your intentions on a computer!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a32876893dd422445e5c93cce2109e888f6384","amp;dn":"ShapeChanger+-+Psychic%2C+Telekinesis+ability+testing+software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a32876893dd422445e5c93cce2109e888f6384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,163,40,118,137,61,212,34,68,94,92,147,204,226,16,158,136,143,99,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
